Gut@@ ach@@ : Increas@@ ed safety for ped@@ est@@ ri@@ ans
They are not even 100 met@@ res apar@@ t: On Tu@@ es@@ day, the new B 33 ped@@ est@@ ri@@ an lights in Dorf@@ par@@ k@@ platz in Gut@@ ach became operational - within view of the existing T@@ own H@@ all traffic ligh@@ ts.
Two sets of lights so close to one an@@ other@@ : inten@@ tional or just a sil@@ ly error@@ ?
Y@@ ester@@ day, Gut@@ acht@@ 's May@@ or gave a clear answer to this question.
"@@ At the time, the T@@ own H@@ all traffic lights were inst@@ alled because this was a school rou@@ te@@ ," explained E@@ ck@@ ert y@@ ester@@ day.
The Kl@@ us@@ er lights protect cyc@@ li@@ sts, as well as those tra@@ v@@ elling by bus and the residents of Berg@@ le.
The system, which officially became operational y@@ ester@@ day, is of importance to the S@@ ul@@ z@@ bach@@ weg@@ /@@ Kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ sse j@@ unc@@ tion.
We have the mus@@ e@@ um, two chur@@ ch@@ es, the sp@@ a gar@@ den@@ s, the bus stop@@ , a doc@@ tor@@ 's practice and a bank, not to mention the traffic from the '@@ G@@ rub@@ ' residential area.
"@@ At times of high road and ped@@ est@@ ri@@ an traff@@ ic, an additional set of lights were required to ensure safet@@ y@@ ," said E@@ ck@@ ert.
This was also confirmed by Peter Ar@@ n@@ old from the Offen@@ burg Di@@ strict Off@@ ic@@ e.
"@@ According to current measure@@ ments, around 12@@ ,000 vehicles travel through the town of Gut@@ ach on the B@@ 33 on a daily basis, of which heavy goods traffic accounts for around ten per cent@@ ," emphasi@@ sed Ar@@ n@@ ol@@ d.
There@@ fore the construction of an additional set of lights was more than necess@@ ar@@ y: "@@ Here safety comes first, it@@ 's that simp@@ le@@ ," said Ar@@ n@@ ol@@ d.
A total of four road safety inspec@@ tions were carried out and a round@@ about was also consider@@ ed, however, this idea was rejected on account of the narrow@@ ness of the S@@ ul@@ z@@ bach@@ weg@@ /@@ Kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ sse j@@ unc@@ tions.
According to Ar@@ n@@ old, every possible test was carried out prior to the selection of the location for the traffic light post@@ s: "@@ Using a goods vehicle lo@@ aded with particularly long tre@@ e tr@@ unk@@ s, we also tested whether such vehicles could access the B 33 from the S@@ ul@@ z@@ bach@@ weg without kno@@ cking over the traffic light post@@ s@@ ".
The traffic light system itself, which cost around EU@@ R 15@@ ,00@@ 0, is the "@@ most modern system that is currently available on the market@@ ," explained Ar@@ n@@ ol@@ d.
The system is fit@@ ted with col@@ ou@@ red LE@@ D@@ s, which are bright enough that drivers can easily see the ligh@@ ts, even when the su@@ n is low in the sk@@ y.
And they are also energy-@@ effici@@ ent: The older light systems consume around 100 W@@ att@@ s, with the new ones consuming just eigh@@ t.
There are three sets of lights per direction of travel@@ .
Ar@@ n@@ old explained the technology used by the new system@@ : It is fit@@ ted with two ra@@ dar sen@@ sor@@ s.
If the ped@@ est@@ ri@@ an pres@@ ses the but@@ ton at the traffic ligh@@ ts, the top ra@@ dar sens@@ or checks the traffic status.
If the street is clear, the ped@@ est@@ ri@@ an ob@@ tains a green light immedi@@ ately, if not, there is a delay of around 15 second@@ s.
An additional ra@@ dar sens@@ or checks whether the green phase for the ped@@ est@@ ri@@ an can be en@@ ded.
"@@ If a group of people or if dis@@ ab@@ led person@@ s are cross@@ ing the stre@@ et, the green phase is exten@@ ded, thus ensuring that everyone gets saf@@ ely across the stre@@ et@@ ," explained Ar@@ n@@ ol@@ d.
Of course, drivers must also play their part and keep their eyes on the ro@@ ad.
Y@@ ester@@ day this was not the cas@@ e: The light had barely turned green for ped@@ est@@ ri@@ ans when a luxury vehicle sp@@ ed through on a red light.
For more than 30 years, Jose@@ f Win@@ kl@@ er has been writing from the hear@@ t, telling of the hard@@ ships of his childhood and you@@ th.

A black box in your car@@ ?
As America's road plann@@ ers struggle to find the cash to men@@ d a crum@@ bling high@@ way system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits ne@@ at@@ ly by the d@@ ash@@ board of your car@@ .
The devic@@ es, which track every m@@ ile a mo@@ tor@@ ist drives and trans@@ mit that information to bureau@@ crats, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offic@@ es to overhau@@ l the out@@ dated system for funding America's major road@@ s.
The usually dul@@ l ar@@ ena of high@@ way planning has suddenly sp@@ aw@@ ned intense debate and col@@ or@@ ful alli@@ ances.
Liber@@ tari@@ ans have joined environmental groups in lobb@@ ying to allow government to use the little box@@ es to keep track of the miles you dri@@ ve, and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill@@ .
The te@@ a party is ag@@ ha@@ st.
The American Civil Liber@@ ties Union is deeply concerne@@ d, too, raising a variety of priv@@ acy issues.
And while Congress can@@ 't agree on whether to proce@@ ed, several states are not wa@@ it@@ ing.
They are expl@@ oring ho@@ w, over the next decade, they can move to a system in which drivers pay per m@@ ile of road they roll over.
Th@@ ous@@ ands of mo@@ tor@@ ists have already taken the black box@@ es, some of which have G@@ P@@ S monit@@ or@@ ing, for a test dri@@ ve.
This really is a must for our nation.
"@@ It is not a matter of something we might choose to do@@ ," said H@@ asan I@@ k@@ hr@@ at@@ a, executive director of the Southern California Ass@@ n. of Govern@@ ments, which is planning for the state to start tra@@ cking miles driven by every California mo@@ tor@@ ist by 20@@ 25.
There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do it.
The push comes as the country's High@@ way T@@ rust Fund, financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump@@ , is bro@@ k@@ e.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
C@@ ars get many more miles to the g@@ all@@ on.
The federal tax itself, 18@@ .@@ 4 cents per g@@ all@@ on, has@@ n't gone up in 20 years.
Politicians are lo@@ ath to raise the tax even one pen@@ n@@ y when gas prices are high.
"@@ The gas tax is just not sustain@@ able@@ ," said Lee Mun@@ nich@@ , a transportation policy expert at the University of M@@ inn@@ es@@ o@@ ta@@ .
His state recently put tra@@ cking de@@ vices on 500 cars to test out a pa@@ y-@@ by-@@ m@@ ile system.
"@@ This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term@@ ," he sa@@ id.
W@@ on@@ ks call it a mi@@ lea@@ ge-@@ based us@@ er fe@@ e.
It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liber@@ als, as the taxes could be ri@@ gged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce con@@ ges@@ tion and greenhouse gas@@ es, for example.
California plann@@ ers are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the stat@@ e's ambitious global warming law@@ s.
But Re@@ p. Bill S@@ hu@@ ster (@@ R-@@ Pa@@ .@@ ), chairman of the House Transpor@@ tation Committe@@ e, has said h@@ e, too, sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free mark@@ e@@ te@@ ers at the Re@@ as@@ on Foundation are also f@@ ond of having drivers pay per mi@@ le.
"@@ This is not just a tax going into a black hol@@ e@@ ," said A@@ dri@@ an Mo@@ ore, vice president of policy at Re@@ as@@ on.
People are paying more directly into what they are ge@@ tt@@ ing.
The movement is also bol@@ stered by two former U@@ .@@ S. Transpor@@ tation sec@@ ret@@ aries, who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pa@@ y-@@ per@@ -@@ m@@ ile direction.
The U@@ .@@ S. Senate approved a $@@ 9@@ 0-@@ million pilo@@ t project last year that would have involved about 10,000 car@@ s.
But the House leadership killed the propos@@ al, acting on concerns of rural law@@ makers representing constitu@@ ents whose daily lives often involve log@@ ging lo@@ ts of miles to get to work or into tow@@ n.
Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own.
The most eager is O@@ reg@@ on, which is en@@ li@@ sting 5,000 drivers in the country's biggest experi@@ ment.
Those drivers will soon pay the mi@@ lea@@ ge fe@@ es instead of gas taxes to the state.
N@@ ev@@ ada has already completed a pilo@@ t.
New York City is looking into one.
I@@ ll@@ ino@@ is is trying it on a limited basis with tru@@ ck@@ s.
And the I@@ -@@ 95 Co@@ ali@@ tion, which includes 17 state transportation depart@@ ments along the Eastern Se@@ abo@@ ard (including Mar@@ y@@ land, P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania, Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and Flori@@ da@@ ), is stud@@ ying how they could go about implementing the change.
The concept is not a universal h@@ it.
In N@@ ev@@ ada, where about 50 volun@@ te@@ ers@@ ' cars were equipped with the de@@ vices not long ago, drivers were un@@ easy about the government being able to monitor their every mo@@ ve.
"@@ Con@@ c@@ ern@@ s about Big Bro@@ ther and those sor@@ ts of things were a major problem@@ ," said Al@@ au@@ d@@ din Kh@@ an, who direc@@ ts strategic and performance management at the N@@ ev@@ ada Department of Transport@@ ation.
It was not something people wan@@ ted.
As the trial got under@@ way, the AC@@ L@@ U of N@@ ev@@ ada warned on its we@@ b@@ si@@ te: "@@ It would be fairly easy to turn these de@@ vices into full-@@ f@@ ledged tra@@ cking devic@@ es@@ ."
There is no need to build an enor@@ mo@@ us, un@@ wiel@@ dy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individu@@ al@@ s' everyday com@@ ings and go@@ ings.
N@@ ev@@ ada is among several states now scra@@ m@@ bling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being dri@@ ven, but not exactly where and at what time.
If you can do that, K@@ han said, the public gets more comfort@@ able.
The h@@ unt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California star@@ tu@@ p called Tru@@ e Mi@@ lea@@ ge.
The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax dri@@ vers.
It was seeking to break into an emerging market in au@@ to insurance, in which drivers would pay based on their mi@@ lea@@ ge.
But the de@@ vices it is testing appeal to high@@ way plann@@ ers because they don't use G@@ P@@ S and deliver a limited amount of information, up@@ lo@@ aded perio@@ dic@@ ally by mo@@ dem@@ .
"@@ People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their loc@@ ation@@ ," said Ry@@ an Mor@@ ri@@ son, chief executive of Tru@@ e Mi@@ lea@@ ge.
There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilo@@ t programs.
There are a lot less expensive and less intru@@ sive ways to do this.
In O@@ reg@@ on, plann@@ ers are experiment@@ ing with giving drivers different choices.
They can choose a de@@ vice with or without G@@ P@@ S.
Or they can choose not to have a de@@ vice at all, op@@ ting instead to pay a flat fe@@ e based on the average number of miles driven by all state resid@@ ents.
Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the de@@ vices do more, not less.
In New York C@@ ity, transportation officials are seeking to develop a tax@@ ing de@@ vice that would also be equipped to pay par@@ king met@@ er fe@@ es, provide "@@ pa@@ y-@@ as-@@ you@@ -@@ dri@@ ve@@ " insurance, and create a pool of real-@@ time speed data from other drivers that mo@@ tor@@ ists could use to avoid traff@@ ic.
"@@ Mo@@ tor@@ ists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them@@ ," says a city planning docum@@ ent.
Some transportation plann@@ ers, though, wonder if all the talk about paying by the m@@ ile is just a giant distrac@@ tion.
At the Met@@ ro@@ poli@@ tan Transpor@@ tation Commission in the San Francis@@ co Bay Are@@ a, officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bankrup@@ t High@@ way T@@ rust Fund by raising gas taxes.
An extra one-@@ time or annual le@@ vy could be imposed on drivers of hybri@@ ds and others whose vehicles don't use much gas, so they pay their fair shar@@ e.
"@@ There is no need for radical surger@@ y when all you need to do is take an asp@@ ir@@ in@@ ," said Rand@@ y Rent@@ schl@@ er, the commission@@ 's director of legislation and public affairs.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their priv@@ acy and a host of other th@@ ings.
KÃ¶nig@@ s@@ fel@@ d: Small team gives a spiri@@ ted performance
The voluntary fire service bra@@ v@@ ely came through the main autum@@ n test run in sp@@ ite of a lack of person@@ n@@ el.
Only el@@ even men took part in the exercis@@ e.
For the training exercis@@ e, depart@@ ment comman@@ der, H@@ ans Kam@@ mer@@ er, chose the Fe@@ der pre@@ mis@@ es on Bur@@ g@@ ber@@ ger Stra@@ s@@ se.
A short-@@ cir@@ cu@@ it was reported to have occurred there during sa@@ w@@ ing.
Two people were in@@ ju@@ red by the resulting fire and the spread of smo@@ ke, however, one was able to make an emergency call@@ .
Two fire fighters equipped with resp@@ ir@@ atory ge@@ ar prepared to enter the building following the initial inspec@@ tion of the situation by H@@ ans Kam@@ mer@@ er.
After a short time they managed to find the first person and direct them out of the build@@ ing.
The second person had to be car@@ ri@@ ed.
This was not so simple as they also had to negotiate a narrow st@@ air@@ well.
The build@@ ing, a work@@ sho@@ p with integrated stab@@ ling for two hor@@ ses, was not easy to secu@@ re.
There were large quanti@@ ties of wo@@ od and bal@@ es of stra@@ w stor@@ ed insi@@ de.
In addition to this, there were also electri@@ cal machines for wo@@ od process@@ ing.
The first attempt to ex@@ ting@@ u@@ ish the fire was made using the t@@ ank on the fire eng@@ ine.
Another line was taken from the surface hy@@ d@@ rant around 100 met@@ res away.
Only three attempts could be made to ex@@ ting@@ u@@ ish the b@@ la@@ ze.
A hol@@ low-@@ stream no@@ zz@@ le in the building was also used.
For H@@ ans Kam@@ mer@@ er, the exercise was also a chance to show what can be achieved with just a few available staff@@ .
In case of emergen@@ cy, support is provided by the KÃ¶nig@@ s@@ feld day@@ time task force.
The Com@@ man@@ der expressed his satisfaction following the exercis@@ e.
Net@@ working between universities and companies is important
On a visit to the distric@@ t of B@@ rei@@ s@@ g@@ au@@ -@@ Hoch@@ schwar@@ z@@ wal@@ d, it was explained to Parliament@@ ary President Gu@@ id@@ o Wol@@ f in Ti@@ ti@@ se@@ e-@@ Neu@@ stadt where the workforce of tomor@@ row will come fro@@ m.
In the Hoch@@ schwar@@ z@@ wal@@ d Sup@@ port Cent@@ re, he addressed this important question alongside the executive princip@@ als of the voc@@ ational col@@ leg@@ es and the distric@@ t gra@@ m@@ mar school and the chair@@ s of the par@@ ents@@ ' counc@@ il.
"@@ Education is an important factor for the loc@@ ation@@ ," highlighted Clau@@ dia Ste@@ h@@ le, Director of the H@@ ans Thom@@ a Scho@@ ol, which introduced the net@@ worked Hoch@@ schwar@@ z@@ wal@@ d Education Cent@@ re Scho@@ ol@@ s Projec@@ t.
During the pres@@ ent@@ ation, Wol@@ f seemed impres@@ sed by the educational pilo@@ t project.
Since 2011, there has been successful collaboration in WÃ¤l@@ der@@ stadt between the Sup@@ port Cent@@ re, the Di@@ strict Gra@@ m@@ mar School and the V@@ oc@@ ational School Comp@@ lex@@ .
He also pra@@ ised the famil@@ y-@@ friendly approach within the distric@@ t.
"@@ It is important, not only to keep the family life stage in mind, but, on account of demographic change, the period spent providing long-term care and support for rel@@ atives as well@@ ," explained Wol@@ f.
He also stated that an increasing number of employed person@@ s are looking after the long-term care and support of rel@@ atives.
"@@ Without support from their employ@@ er, the resulting burden placed on employees could result in the termin@@ ation of the employment contrac@@ t@@ ," said Wol@@ f.
However, nobody can afford to lose qualified work@@ ers@@ ," he ad@@ ded.
Ano@@ ther, particularly important factor is that of net@@ working between universities and companies.
"@@ After all, people who have learned of the mer@@ its of the region during their studies often remain within the region, along with their acquired knowledge and skills, which contributes to the strengthening of the region@@ ," said the State Parliament@@ ary Presid@@ ent, expres@@ sing his thor@@ ough convic@@ tion.
For it is only if a sufficient number of educational places can be provided that the need for skilled workers can be cover@@ ed.
In his opinion, the distric@@ t@@ 's advantage as a location is its advanta@@ geous location in sou@@ th-@@ west Germany, in immediate proxim@@ ity to France and Switzer@@ land.
In addition to this, on his train jour@@ ney from Ti@@ ti@@ se@@ e-@@ Neu@@ stadt to Frei@@ bur@@ g, he experienced first-@@ hand the efforts already undertaken to develop public transpor@@ t.
"@@ You must continue to be ten@@ aci@@ ous and make sure that local public transport becomes even bet@@ ter@@ ," he explained in the address given to the local politicians in atten@@ d@@ ance.
Musi@@ c makes for an entertain@@ ing after@@ no@@ on
It was 15 years ago that the K@@ au@@ l family first invited the Di@@ et@@ ingen senior citizens for coff@@ ee and c@@ ak@@ e, followed by a sn@@ ack@@ .
Pre@@ viously, the elderly citizens were ho@@ sted in the service station can@@ te@@ en.
The coff@@ ee after@@ no@@ on is now held in the St. Jose@@ f nur@@ sing home.
The residents of the home were de@@ ligh@@ ted with the deli@@ cious c@@ ak@@ es and tar@@ ts.
L@@ ater on, a s@@ aus@@ age sal@@ ad was provi@@ ded.
Sil@@ via Kim@@ m@@ ich@@ -@@ B@@ ant@@ le and her father Karl Kim@@ mich entertain@@ ed those in atten@@ d@@ ance with popular tun@@ es.
The more than 100@@ -@@ year-old natural stone w@@ all, serving as the foremo@@ st bound@@ ary between the old school y@@ ard - which is due to be ren@@ ov@@ ated - and Kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ s@@ se, will once again feature on the ren@@ ov@@ ation cost plan for the town of B@@ rÃ¤@@ un@@ ling@@ en.
In the days before the Kil@@ big Aut@@ um@@ n Fol@@ k Fes@@ tiv@@ al, when the first ren@@ ov@@ ation work was being carried out at the front of the school yar@@ d, a small cor@@ ner wall with bal@@ u@@ stra@@ des was inst@@ alled to stabili@@ se and re@@ lie@@ ve the st@@ atic lo@@ ad on the old natural stone w@@ all, which is more than one hundred years ol@@ d.
According to Alexander Mis@@ ok of the B@@ rÃ¤@@ un@@ lingen Muni@@ cip@@ al Pl@@ ann@@ ing and Building Con@@ tro@@ l Auth@@ ority, the ongoing proced@@ ure plans to involve the Region@@ al Mem@@ ori@@ al Authority in the planning stage and to draw up a ren@@ ov@@ ation concept for the old w@@ all.
A cost calcul@@ ation is to be performed by a team of profession@@ als, which will then be sub@@ mitted to the T@@ own Council, which will make a decision and determine the ongoing procedu@@ re.
A decision is expected to be made in the coming year.
Following the ren@@ ov@@ ation, pla@@ stering and plan@@ ting of tre@@ es in the old internal school yar@@ d, within the two w@@ ings of the 19@@ 12 school, as a subsequent measure the bound@@ ary w@@ all, which is in need of ref@@ ur@@ bis@@ h@@ ment, must be ren@@ ov@@ ated from the ground up within the foreseeable future.
The histor@@ ic, one hund@@ re@@ d-@@ year-old bound@@ ary wall between the old school@@ -@@ y@@ ard and Kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ sse is in need of ren@@ ov@@ ation, primarily as a result of water and fro@@ st dam@@ age, on account of the lack of dra@@ in@@ age, and is lean@@ ing forwar@@ ds.
De@@ ep cra@@ cks in a number of individual st@@ ones t@@ esti@@ fy to the weather dam@@ age, however, at present the wall is not in danger of collapse.
A secure wall is essential for a school y@@ ard that is used by p@@ up@@ il@@ s, and this is the purpose of the current for@@ ti@@ fication work.
The school y@@ ard ren@@ ov@@ ation was originally planned back in 2008@@ /@@ 2009, however, high un@@ planned expen@@ ses meant that the work had to be pushed back.
The Region@@ al Mem@@ ori@@ al Authority will have a major say in the historic school wall ren@@ ov@@ ation, which has even been used for fil@@ m@@ ing.
If this authority were to impose require@@ ments, then the town of B@@ rÃ¤@@ un@@ lingen would hope to receive subsidies from the monum@@ ent preser@@ v@@ ation@@ ists.
The p@@ up@@ ils of the B@@ rÃ¤@@ un@@ lingen Prim@@ ary Scho@@ ol, who are now being taught in a well ren@@ ov@@ ated old school build@@ ing, with a new h@@ all, will soon be able to use the old school y@@ ard as well.

US bor@@ der@@ s: "@@ Sup@@ er tun@@ n@@ el@@ " for drug smugg@@ ling discovered
On the border between Mexico and the USA, investig@@ ators have discovered and shut down a "@@ sup@@ er tun@@ n@@ el@@ " intended for drug smugg@@ l@@ ing.
As announced by the US C@@ ustom@@ s Auth@@ ori@@ ties, the pi@@ pe between Ti@@ ju@@ ana and San Di@@ e@@ go, meas@@ uring more than 500 met@@ res in leng@@ th, was equipped with electricity, a rail@@ way track and a ven@@ til@@ ation system.
Three suspec@@ ts were de@@ tained in relation to the discover@@ y, with eight t@@ onn@@ es of mari@@ ju@@ ana and almost 150 k@@ ilogra@@ ms of coc@@ ain@@ e sei@@ zed.
According to the details provi@@ ded, the tun@@ nel had not yet been put into use.
"@@ These car@@ tels are stup@@ id if they think that they can dig through under the ra@@ dar@@ ," said the US At@@ tor@@ ney for the Di@@ strict of Southern Californi@@ a, Lau@@ ra Di@@ ff@@ y, at a press conference held in front of a war@@ eh@@ ous@@ e in San Di@@ e@@ go, where the end of the tun@@ nel was discover@@ ed.
Re@@ fer@@ ring to the drug gang@@ s, Du@@ ff@@ y assu@@ re@@ d: "@@ If you continue to build and attempt to use these tun@@ n@@ els, we are determined to make this a big waste of your dir@@ ty money@@ ".
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are engaged in an ongoing battle against the drug car@@ tel@@ s.
Since 2006, more than 7@@ 7@@ ,000 people have been killed in con@@ j@@ unc@@ tion with drug crime in Mexico@@ .
Buil@@ t by experts
D@@ ue to the el@@ abor@@ ate conf@@ ig@@ u@@ ration of the tun@@ n@@ el, investig@@ ators are working on the assumption that it was build by architec@@ ts and engineers and that the construction took around one year.
The rail@@ way system was equipped in such a way that electric@@ ally powered car@@ ts could be used on it.
On the Mexican side, the ent@@ ran@@ ce is located in a building located 80 met@@ res from the border.
According to the authorities, a lad@@ der runs 20 met@@ res underground to the actual ent@@ ran@@ ce of the tun@@ n@@ el.
The tun@@ nel has a cross-@@ sec@@ tion meas@@ uring 1.@@ 20 met@@ res high and 90 cen@@ tim@@ et@@ res acro@@ s@@ s.
It would thus be su@@ itable to assist illegal immigration into the USA.
Two of the suspec@@ ts were de@@ tained in con@@ j@@ unc@@ tion with the coc@@ ain@@ e fin@@ d.
The thir@@ d, a Mex@@ ic@@ an, was de@@ tained due to the sei@@ z@@ ure of the mari@@ ju@@ an@@ a.
All three face a maximum pen@@ alty of life imprison@@ ment, according to the authorities.
Since 2006, eight tun@@ n@@ els of this type have been discover@@ ed, the press conference in San Di@@ eg@@ o continu@@ ed.
However, this was the first time that coc@@ ain@@ e was found in such a tun@@ nel construc@@ tion.
Nor@@ m@@ ally coc@@ ain@@ e is smugg@@ led in smaller quanti@@ ties and not through tun@@ n@@ el@@ s.
This shows the "@@ desper@@ ation@@ " of the drug gang@@ s, whose traditional ro@@ utes have now been cut off, said Bill S@@ her@@ man of the D@@ EA Drug Squ@@ ad in San Di@@ ego@@ .
They will do anything to make it to the USA.
No specific details were given regarding those detain@@ ed, but it is reported that at least one is Mexican
They can expect prison terms of up to ten years.

On the Fri@@ day there will be a cerem@@ on@@ y, and on the Sat@@ ur@@ day and Sun@@ day a party will be held at the Kir@@ cht@@ al@@ hal@@ le.
The Kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ Haus@@ en Kir@@ chen@@ fest fes@@ tiv@@ al will also be held on this celeb@@ rat@@ ory week@@ end.
T@@ own Musi@@ cal Direc@@ tor, Rud@@ ol@@ f Bar@@ th, has composed a commission@@ ed piece for the town on the occasion of the annivers@@ ary, which will be performed on three dat@@ es.
On 21 June, in con@@ j@@ unc@@ tion with the Schwarz@@ wal@@ d@@ ver@@ ein [@@ Black For@@ est Associ@@ ation@@ ] M@@ id@@ -S@@ um@@ mer Fes@@ tiv@@ al, on 12 July in the Ar@@ en@@ a, accompanied by fire@@ work@@ s, and on 13 December as the first conc@@ ert put on by the Stadt@@ musi@@ k (T@@ own Musi@@ cal Soci@@ et@@ y) in the new Fes@@ tiv@@ al H@@ all.
This ven@@ ue will be completed and in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ated in the anniversary year, with the official date set for the last week@@ end in September, on 27 and 28 Septem@@ ber.
On the occasion of the Gei@@ sin@@ gen town annivers@@ ary, a new chron@@ ic@@ le will also be publi@@ sh@@ ed.
"@@ However, it will not merely be a chron@@ ic@@ le of Gei@@ sin@@ gen itself, but rather a prin@@ ted work on the Gei@@ sin@@ gen of today, which now consists of Gei@@ sing@@ en, Kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ Haus@@ en, Lei@@ p@@ fer@@ ding@@ en, A@@ ul@@ fin@@ gen and Gut@@ mad@@ in@@ gen@@ ," said May@@ or W@@ alter H@@ eng@@ st@@ l@@ er.
And the Gei@@ sin@@ gen of today is also celeb@@ rating a birth@@ day in 2014, as it was in 1974 that the incorpor@@ ations to form the current region were comple@@ ted.
The new chron@@ ic@@ le is to be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Fes@@ tiv@@ al H@@ all in Gei@@ sing@@ en.
However, 2014 is also a year of many annivers@@ aries in other respec@@ ts.
The Nar@@ ren@@ zun@@ ft St@@ roh@@ g@@ lon@@ ki (@@ St@@ roh@@ g@@ lon@@ ki Fo@@ ol@@ 's Gu@@ il@@ d celeb@@ ration@@ ) begins on 8 February with an ev@@ ening of traditional customs on the occasion of its 60@@ -year annivers@@ ar@@ y@@ / The Har@@ mon@@ ie Gut@@ mad@@ ingen musi@@ c association will turn 90 years old and on 29 March will hold a celeb@@ rat@@ ory ban@@ qu@@ et and then from 1 to 4 May will be celeb@@ rating the Bezir@@ ks@@ fest [@@ Di@@ strict Musi@@ c Fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ ]@@ .
The Lei@@ p@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen N@@ ur@@ sing Home will turn 40 years old, the Gei@@ sin@@ gen School has now been at its new location for 50 years and will be celeb@@ rating this on 10 May, and the Pol@@ y@@ hy@@ m@@ ni@@ a Lei@@ p@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen musi@@ c association will turn 150 years old and will be celeb@@ rating this as part of the Brun@@ n@@ en@@ fest [@@ F@@ oun@@ tain Fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ ] from 4 to 7 Jul@@ y.
The town of Gei@@ sin@@ gen was first officially documented in the year 7@@ 6@@ 4, in a de@@ ed of don@@ ation, which is now in the poss@@ ession of the St. G@@ allen Mon@@ ast@@ er@@ y.
The de@@ ed was drawn up in Kir@@ chen (@@ Haus@@ en), which at the time was the location of the cour@@ thous@@ e.
Both communities are thus mentioned in the same de@@ ed.
One reason for choosing 2014 to celebrate the 1,@@ 2@@ 50@@ -year anniversary in this way, is that it also coinci@@ des with the 40@@ th anniversary of the Community Reform (@@ Gemein@@ der@@ e@@ form@@ ).
Council sets its sigh@@ ts on ra@@ il system
Should the "@@ Am Hir@@ schen@@ " rail@@ way cross@@ ing be reconstruc@@ ted at great cost, in order to increase traffic safet@@ y?
The T@@ own Counc@@ ils have decided that the answer is y@@ es.
Sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach will have to contribute up to EU@@ R 2@@ 20,000 to the project.
The Deutsche Bah@@ n hopes to improve the Kin@@ zig@@ tal rail@@ way line in the coming year.
In particular, safety at rail@@ way cross@@ ings is to be increased - col@@ li@@ sions between tra@@ ins and other vehicles frequently occur at these across the country.
If the municip@@ alities agree to the reconstruction measures, they will be required to contribute one third of the costs, with the remain@@ der divided between Deutsche Bah@@ n and the Federal Govern@@ ment.
Sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach@@ 's town master mas@@ on, Rol@@ and Gri@@ e@@ Ã@@ hab@@ er, explained the peculi@@ arities of the "@@ Am Hir@@ schen@@ " rail@@ way cross@@ ing to the T@@ own Council.
At the cross@@ ing, the town is planning to increase the hei@@ ght of the mou@@ th of the tun@@ nel to the west of the rail@@ way line.
Lar@@ ger vehic@@ les, for example those that transport long log@@ s, would be able to wait there in the event of on@@ coming traff@@ ic, without having to block the rail@@ way line.
Gri@@ e@@ Ã@@ haber therefore suggested that a required supporting wall be construc@@ ted in such a way that the town could in due course wi@@ den the ad@@ joining street in order to guarantee the smooth flow of traff@@ ic.
This was the subject of controversial discussion in the T@@ own Council, as some coun@@ cil members cast doubt over the need to wi@@ den the road@@ : Thomas K@@ ip@@ p summ@@ ar@@ ised the perspective of the critics with this stat@@ ement@@ : "@@ Do we have to hand over so much money on account of so few vehic@@ les@@ ?"
May@@ or Thomas Ha@@ as re@@ tor@@ te@@ d: The "@@ Hir@@ schen@@ " rail@@ way cross@@ ing is used regularly for the transportation of long log@@ s.
Even wo@@ od from the "@@ K@@ uh@@ bach@@ " area is occasionally transpor@@ ted via this rou@@ te, as the vehic@@ les, which measure 20 met@@ res in leng@@ th, would not be able to use the route via the HÃ¤@@ ber@@ les Bri@@ d@@ ge, as they would not be able to make the turn on the Haupt@@ stra@@ s@@ se.
Furthermore, when the Haupt@@ stra@@ sse is block@@ ed, the route would also serve as a b@@ yp@@ ass for those vehicles that are not permitted to use the tun@@ n@@ el, argued Ha@@ as.
Given that it is likely that the Kir@@ ch@@ berg and Sch@@ loss@@ berg tun@@ nel will have to be reconstruc@@ ted and ren@@ ov@@ ated, as is currently the case in Wol@@ fach@@ , the "@@ Am Hir@@ schen@@ " rail@@ way cross@@ ing may become of major traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The counc@@ ill@@ ors agreed to have an investigation conducted as to what costs the planned widening of the road would incur@@ .
Nevertheless, the reconstruction of the rail@@ way cross@@ ing was cons@@ ented to by a maj@@ ority, on the provision that the required supporting wall be built in such a way that the town could, if require@@ d, extend the connec@@ ting road in the "@@ Bah@@ n@@ ho@@ f@@ stra@@ Ã@@ e" direction to around 5.@@ 5 met@@ res to accommodate on@@ coming traff@@ ic.
The reconstruction of the rail@@ way cross@@ ing at the Trau@@ t@@ wei@@ n t@@ ann@@ ery could, on the other hand, bring with it an entirely different problem with regard to access to the ste@@ ep "@@ Ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ hÃ¤us@@ er Weg@@ ".
The Administ@@ ra@@ tive Department had Deutsche Bah@@ n@@ 's reconstruction plans investig@@ ated by the Bre@@ in@@ ling@@ er Engine@@ ering Off@@ ic@@ e, as they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ hÃ¤us@@ er Weg will be straight@@ forward.
The investigation came to the conclusion that it could not be ruled out that the inc@@ lin@@ ation of the road could result in longer vehicles becoming stu@@ ck.
The tow@@ n, as the authority responsible for road construc@@ tion, would then bear responsibility for this.
The reconstruction could therefore result in liability disput@@ es.
Because both the transportation of wo@@ od and turning are both possible as things are, the reconstruction of the rail@@ way cross@@ ing should not be cons@@ ented to, argued Ha@@ as.
At this point, the risk of a train col@@ li@@ sion with a vehicle posi@@ tioned on the cross@@ ing is considerably lower than at other rail@@ way cross@@ ings, on account of the fact that there is a mid@@ point from which there is a good line of sigh@@ t, directly alongside the stopp@@ ing point.
The tra@@ ins themselves, coming from the central st@@ ation, must also be sufficiently slowed down so that there is no threat of col@@ li@@ sion.
According to the counc@@ ill@@ ors, the reconstruction of this rail@@ way line was rejected by a maj@@ ority, as the town of Sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach would "@@ bear the br@@ unt of the cost@@ " for the problem of vehicles becoming stu@@ ck, since the Deutsche Bah@@ n would be able to deny any responsibility following the comple@@ tion of the construction work.
The committee considers the reconstruction of the "@@ Vor He@@ ub@@ ach@@ " and '@@ Vor K@@ uh@@ bach@@ " rail@@ way cross@@ ings, for which the cross@@ ing agreements have already been reached with Deutsche Bah@@ n, to be un@@ problemati@@ c.
ES@@ A makes decision on major space mission@@ s: Mis@@ sions cost@@ ing billions
Di@@ st@@ ant plan@@ ets, gra@@ vit@@ ational waves or black hol@@ es - experts from the European Sp@@ ace Agency must now agree on two major projects that are to be launched in the coming years.
There were 30 proposals to choose fro@@ m, five of which are still in the run@@ ning.
Di@@ st@@ ant world@@ s.
A@@ str@@ onom@@ ers have already found more than 1,000 plan@@ ets near other star@@ s.
Whether or not life exists on at least some of th@@ ese, no-@@ one know@@ s.
The choice is a difficult on@@ e: Should we search for gra@@ vit@@ ational wa@@ v@@ es?
Or instead conduct research into the origin of the co@@ smo@@ s?
Or search for plan@@ ets similar to the Earth and thus perhaps discover ext@@ rat@@ er@@ res@@ trial life@@ ?
These are the questions currently being asked by those responsible at the European Sp@@ ace Agen@@ cy, ES@@ A.
For their "@@ Co@@ sm@@ ic Vi@@ sion@@ " programm@@ e, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects, which should greatly advance research.
The budget for "@@ L@@ -@@ Mis@@ sions@@ " such as this lies at around one billion Euro.
The projects are planned to start in 20@@ 28 and 203@@ 4.
At the beginning of September, the elite in the field of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such mission@@ s.
30 ideas were up for debate, of which five have now made it onto the short li@@ st.
Num@@ erous pan@@ els are assessing the propos@@ als, posing questions to the resear@@ ch@@ ers.
Over the coming days, a final decision is to be made by the Scienti@@ fic Programme Committe@@ e.
In tot@@ al, four main questions were chosen by the ES@@ A, to which the missions of the "@@ Co@@ sm@@ ic Vi@@ sion@@ " programm@@ e, initiated in 2007, are to find the answer@@ s.
What are the conditions required for the formation of plan@@ ets and life@@ ?
The precise processes for the formation of stars from large gas clou@@ ds - and thus the formation of the plan@@ ets that or@@ bit these stars - lie in pro@@ ver@@ bial dark@@ ness.
A large in@@ fra@@ -@@ red tel@@ es@@ cope in space could penet@@ rate this dark@@ ness.
And if a star has plan@@ ets, under what circumstances can life exist there@@ ?
In order to pursue this question, the "@@ Che@@ op@@ s" space tel@@ es@@ cope is to be launched in 201@@ 7, with which 500 known plan@@ etary systems in proxim@@ ity to us will be investig@@ ated in greater detail@@ .
The possibilities are, however, limited - Che@@ ops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million Euro.
With larger instru@@ ments, ast@@ r@@ onom@@ ers could map plan@@ ets similar to Earth and even analy@@ se the composition of their atmosp@@ her@@ es, and thus search for "@@ biom@@ ark@@ ers@@ "@@ : gas@@ es that serve as an indicator for biological activity.
How does the solar system func@@ tion?
This question should also provide information regarding the pre@@ conditions for the origins of life.
The mag@@ ne@@ tic activity of a star@@ , the inter@@ action of its mag@@ ne@@ tic field and the emit@@ ted par@@ ticle radiation play an important role.
It is possible to investig@@ ate these processes in our solar system, to serve as an example to be applied elsewhere.
With the "@@ Sol@@ ar Or@@ bit@@ er@@ ", the ES@@ A has already approved an M-@@ class mission (for which the budget stands at around half a million Euro@@ ) to address this matter.
The probe is to be launched in 2017 and will closely ob@@ serve the surface and activity of the sun@@ .
J@@ up@@ it@@ er and its mo@@ ons are also of great interest to the resear@@ ch@@ ers.
They want to find our what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
The ES@@ A is planning that the first of the total of three L@@ -@@ Mis@@ sions of the "@@ Co@@ sm@@ ic Vi@@ sion@@ " programme will address this subjec@@ t.
The "@@ Ju@@ ic@@ e" (@@ J@@ up@@ it@@ er I@@ cy Mo@@ ons Ex@@ pl@@ or@@ er) probe is planned to begin its jour@@ ney in 20@@ 2@@ 2.
Eig@@ ht years later it will reach J@@ up@@ it@@ er and will investig@@ ate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the ic@@ y mo@@ ons Europa, C@@ alli@@ st@@ o and G@@ any@@ me@@ de.
What are the basic physical laws of the Uni@@ ver@@ se?
O@@ uter space offers many possibilities for stud@@ ying subst@@ ances under extreme conditions and thus exam@@ ining whether the laws of nature, as known to us, are still vali@@ d there.
There may also be devi@@ ations that could show physi@@ cians the path to a new theory, under the um@@ br@@ ell@@ a of which all known natural laws could be unit@@ ed.
How did the uni@@ verse come about and what does it consi@@ st of@@ ?
1@@ 3.@@ 7 billion years ago, our co@@ smo@@ s was created by the Big Bang@@ .
Al@@ ong@@ side the materials familiar to us, from which star@@ s, plan@@ ets and life forms such as ourselves are com@@ pos@@ ed, there exists dark matter, the gra@@ vit@@ ational force of which holds gal@@ a@@ xi@@ es and gal@@ ax@@ y clu@@ sters together, and dark energy, the effects of which accelerate the expansion of the univer@@ se.
Th@@ us far, researchers know neither which physical laws applied in the initial moments after the Big Bang@@ , nor what dark matter and dark energy consi@@ st of@@ .
With "@@ E@@ uc@@ li@@ d@@ ", the ES@@ A has already approved an M-@@ mission, planned to commen@@ ce in 2020.
With a special tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e, the probe is to examine the distribution of material in the uni@@ verse across the entire sky, thus enabling conclusions to be drawn regarding the proper@@ ties of dark matter and dark energy.
Pro@@ pos@@ als that are in the run@@ n@@ ing@@ ...
Of the 30 propos@@ als, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedu@@ re.
The proposal with the best chance of approval as an L@@ -@@ mission, in the opinion of many exper@@ ts, is "@@ E-@@ Lis@@ a@@ ", a demanding concept that aims to prove the existence of gra@@ vit@@ ational wa@@ ves.
Many physi@@ cians perceive this to entail changes in the structure of spac@@ e-@@ time, which Al@@ bert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
To date they have never been proved to exist.
The scientists behind the project hope that Eli@@ sa could achieve this.
The mission involves placing a detec@@ tor, consi@@ sting of two or three pro@@ bes@@ , in ou@@ ter spac@@ e.
Unlike systems on Ear@@ th, it could also prove gra@@ vit@@ ational waves created during the Big Bang@@ , and thus provide fresh knowledge regarding the origin of the co@@ smo@@ s.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L@@ -@@ mission plac@@ e: a large X@@ -@@ ra@@ y tel@@ es@@ cope called "@@ Ath@@ en@@ a@@ ", which among other things would research black hol@@ es, "@@ I@@ cy Plan@@ et@@ s@@ ", another mission to the ou@@ ter plan@@ ets of the solar system, "@@ pri@@ sm@@ ", a mission for the measure@@ ment of co@@ sm@@ ic background radi@@ ation, and the "@@ Ex@@ op@@ lan@@ et Fin@@ der@@ ", which would find and investig@@ ate plan@@ ets similar to Ear@@ th.
Among others, proposals that have already been ruled out include proposals for bringing sam@@ ples back from Mar@@ s, conduc@@ ting research on the mo@@ on, V@@ en@@ us and ast@@ ero@@ id@@ s, as well as proposals in the area of solar physi@@ cs.
Snow@@ den ready to "@@ cooper@@ at@@ e" with Germany over US surveillance
Edward Snow@@ den, the US intelligence wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ , has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director K@@ ei@@ th Alexander fail to provide answers about its activities.
German M@@ P H@@ ans@@ -@@ Christian St@@ rÃ¶@@ bel@@ e on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day met M@@ r Snow@@ den in Russia, where he has been granted asyl@@ um, to discuss him t@@ esti@@ fying in Germany.
A letter from M@@ r Snow@@ den, presented to the media in Berlin on Fri@@ day by the MP@@ , sa@@ id@@ : "@@ Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstra@@ bly posi@@ tive, my government continues to treat dis@@ sent as defec@@ tion, and seeks to crimin@@ ali@@ se political speech with fel@@ ony charges that provide no def@@ enc@@ e@@ ."
However, speaking the truth is not a cri@@ me.
In the let@@ ter, M@@ r Snow@@ den said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The charges fil@@ ed by the US justice depart@@ ment include es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and th@@ eft of government proper@@ ty.
H@@ ans@@ -@@ Peter Fried@@ rich, German inter@@ ior minister, told Zeit On@@ lin@@ e: "@@ If M@@ r Snow@@ den is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possi@@ ble@@ ."
Rel@@ ations between the US and Germany have come under strain following claims that the N@@ SA bu@@ gged Chancellor Angel@@ a's Merk@@ el@@ 's ph@@ one.
Thomas Op@@ perman@@ n, the M@@ P who heads the parliamentary panel that overse@@ es intelligen@@ ce, said that if there were an opportunity to hear M@@ r Snow@@ den as a witness "@@ without bringing him into danger and completely ru@@ ining relations with the US@@ ," it should be taken.
M@@ r St@@ rÃ¶@@ bel@@ e, an M@@ P for Germany's Green party, published a picture of himself with M@@ r Snow@@ den on his Twitter fe@@ ed.
He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journ@@ alists.
M@@ r St@@ rÃ¶@@ bel@@ e said that, according to the former N@@ SA contrac@@ tor@@ 's lawy@@ er, M@@ r Snow@@ den would not be able to return to Russia if he left.
If M@@ r Snow@@ den t@@ esti@@ fied in Germany he would need assur@@ ances that he would be "@@ saf@@ e" there, the M@@ P sa@@ id.
M@@ r Snow@@ den said in his letter that he had faced a "@@ severe and sustain@@ ed@@ " campaign of persecu@@ tion that forced him from his home.
Ho@@ wever he said that he was hear@@ ten@@ ed by the worldwide response to "@@ my act of political expres@@ sion@@ ."
Citiz@@ ens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the revel@@ ation of an un@@ accountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public servic@@ e.
The letter extends an offer to cooperate with German authorities "@@ when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resol@@ v@@ ed@@ ."
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines to charge for car@@ r@@ y-@@ on bag@@ g@@ age
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines plans to charge up to $100 for passen@@ gers to store car@@ r@@ y-@@ on lu@@ gg@@ age on board their f@@ light.
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines plans to start charg@@ ing up to $100 for a car@@ r@@ y-@@ on b@@ ag and $2 for coff@@ ee or so@@ da, although its announcement on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day did say that passen@@ gers will get to keep the whole can@@ .
The new car@@ r@@ y-@@ on fe@@ e is for bag@@ s in the over@@ head bin@@ , so small bag@@ s under the seat will still be free.
Fron@@ tier said it will charge $@@ 25 if the fe@@ e is paid in adv@@ ance, $100 if travel@@ ers wait to pay until the@@ y@@ '@@ re at the g@@ ate.
Fron@@ tier spo@@ kes@@ woman K@@ ate O@@ '@@ M@@ alle@@ y said the $100 fe@@ e is to get travel@@ ers to take care of the charge in adv@@ ance.
"@@ We don't want to charge that@@ ," she sa@@ id.
Air@@ lines began charg@@ ing for the first and second check@@ ed bag@@ s in 2008.
Pas@@ sen@@ gers trying to avoid those fe@@ es have been stu@@ ff@@ ing as much as they can into car@@ r@@ y-@@ on bag@@ g@@ age st@@ ash@@ ed in over@@ head bin@@ s, meaning those b@@ ins often run out of spac@@ e.
F@@ ees are one way to get passen@@ gers to bring less on boar@@ d.
O@@ '@@ M@@ alle@@ y said the new charge is not really about raising money.
It@@ 's about Fron@@ tier@@ 's most loyal customers making it very clear that finding over@@ head bin space has become increasingly difficult.
Pas@@ sen@@ gers who buy their tick@@ ets on the air@@ lin@@ e's we@@ b@@ site won@@ 't have to pa@@ y.
That means one passen@@ ger in line at a Fron@@ tier g@@ ate might get to bring a b@@ ag on for free, while the next person in line might owe $100 for a similar bag@@ .
O@@ '@@ M@@ alle@@ y said Fron@@ tier@@ 's we@@ b@@ site and check@@ -@@ in procedures are being changed to make sure passen@@ gers know about the fe@@ e before they get to the g@@ ate.
Fron@@ tier@@ 's new car@@ r@@ y-@@ on fe@@ e won@@ 't start until summer, though a date has@@ n't been s@@ et.
Pas@@ sen@@ gers often g@@ rum@@ ble about bag@@ g@@ age charges and other fe@@ es, but air@@ lines love them.
They argue that lu@@ gg@@ age costs money to hand@@ le, and passen@@ gers who want the service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street view the addition of bag@@ g@@ age fe@@ es as a sign that air@@ lines are charg@@ ing enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most ha@@ ven@@ 't tou@@ ched car@@ r@@ y-@@ on b@@ ag fe@@ es, though@@ .
Spi@@ ri@@ t Air@@ lines In@@ c. started the first car@@ r@@ y-@@ on fe@@ e three years ago, and fellow dis@@ counter Al@@ legi@@ ant Air later follow@@ ed.
The only other air@@ line with such a fe@@ e is Hung@@ ar@@ y's W@@ iz@@ z A@@ ir, said air@@ line consult@@ ant J@@ ay Sor@@ ens@@ en, who closely tra@@ cks add@@ -@@ on fe@@ es.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spi@@ rit@@ 's car@@ r@@ y-@@ on fe@@ e brings in $50 million a year.
Sor@@ ens@@ en, a former executive with M@@ id@@ west Air@@ lines, fle@@ w Spi@@ ri@@ t recently and won@@ dered what he@@ '@@ d find at the g@@ ate as passen@@ gers en@@ counter@@ ed Spi@@ rit@@ 's unusual car@@ r@@ y-@@ on b@@ ag fe@@ e.
"@@ The boar@@ ding process was the smoo@@ th@@ est I had seen in my air@@ line care@@ er@@ ," he sa@@ id.
I was expec@@ ting to see gn@@ ash@@ ing of te@@ eth and a fight breaking out at the g@@ ate.
The plane was ful@@ l, he said, "@@ and it boar@@ ded li@@ ck@@ et@@ y-@@ split@@ ."
Fron@@ tier is also following Spi@@ rit@@ 's $2 charge for coff@@ e@@ e, te@@ a, so@@ da, or ju@@ ic@@ e.
Fron@@ tier said passen@@ gers who get so@@ da or ju@@ ice can keep the whole can, and it will give coff@@ ee ref@@ ills for free.
It will still give away water.
US Air@@ ways brief@@ ly tried charg@@ ing for be@@ ver@@ ages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passen@@ gers complained and no other major air@@ line follow@@ ed.
Fron@@ tier@@ 's move to charge the car@@ r@@ y-@@ on fe@@ e if passen@@ gers don't buy direct from the air@@ line is its latest effort to ste@@ er customers toward its own we@@ b@@ si@@ te.
Air@@ lines pay online travel sell@@ ers such as Or@@ bit@@ z $10 to $@@ 25 for each tick@@ et sol@@ d.
That has given all air@@ lines an incentive to ste@@ er passen@@ gers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agen@@ cy.
Fron@@ tier has gone the fur@@ th@@ est in this area, though@@ .
In September it began giving half as many frequent f@@ lier miles to customers who bought through an online travel agen@@ cy.
On W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day it slas@@ hed the mi@@ lea@@ ge a@@ ward to 25 perc@@ ent of the miles of the tri@@ p.
So, a 1,000 m@@ ile Fron@@ tier trip purchas@@ ed from an online travel agency would earn 250 mil@@ es.
It also allows passen@@ gers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the Fron@@ tier we@@ b@@ si@@ te.
Fron@@ tier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of Den@@ ver, but its business is shrinking and losing money.
Re@@ ven@@ ue dropped 9 perc@@ ent and its fl@@ ying capacity shr@@ ank almost 13 perc@@ ent in the first quar@@ ter, according to financial results released W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day by corporate par@@ ent Republic Air@@ ways Hol@@ dings In@@ c.
Republic has been trying to fix Fron@@ tier@@ 's finances as part of selling the air@@ line.
S@@ ay@@ ings come from the Bi@@ ble
At least 40 women attended the last wom@@ en@@ 's break@@ fast of the year, in the Ev@@ ange@@ lical Par@@ ish of Bis@@ ing@@ en.
The them@@ e of the day in the par@@ ish hal@@ l was "@@ S@@ ay@@ ings from the Bi@@ ble@@ " and "@@ Ex@@ pres@@ sions from the Middle A@@ ges@@ ".
Z@@ ita KÃ¶@@ hl@@ er, the Chair@@ person of the Par@@ ish Council, agreed to give a talk on Bi@@ bli@@ cal pro@@ verb@@ s after break@@ fast.
"@@ Pro@@ verb@@ s contain pe@@ ar@@ ls of wis@@ dom@@ , comm@@ and@@ ments or warn@@ ing@@ s@@ ," she expla@@ in@@ ed.
She compared several German say@@ ings with the cor@@ responding Bi@@ ble ver@@ ses and explained the mean@@ ing.
She referred to say@@ ings such as@@ : "@@ Hol@@ z@@ au@@ ge sei wach@@ sam@@ " (@@ keep your eyes pe@@ el@@ ed@@ ), "@@ wie Sch@@ upp@@ en von den Augen fall@@ en" (@@ like sc@@ ales falling from one@@ 's ey@@ es), "@@ ein Auge auf jemand wer@@ fen@@ " (@@ to cast an eye on some@@ one@@ ), "@@ den S@@ einen gib@@ t@@ 's der Her@@ r im Schl@@ af@@ " (@@ good things come to some when they sle@@ ep@@ ) and "@@ seine HÃ¤nde in Un@@ schuld wa@@ schen@@ " (@@ to w@@ ash one@@ 's hands of someth@@ ing@@ ).
On several occa@@ sions, the spe@@ aker asked those list@@ ening to gu@@ ess what pro@@ ver@@ b they were based on.
Ex@@ pres@@ sions from the Middle A@@ ges were addressed by Par@@ ish Counc@@ ill@@ or Christ@@ el D@@ eh@@ ner@@ : "@@ All@@ er guten Dinge sind drei@@ " (@@ All good things come in thre@@ es), "@@ b@@ la@@ u mach@@ en" (@@ to sk@@ ip school@@ /@@ work@@ ), "@@ etwas ver@@ hau@@ en" (@@ to wal@@ lo@@ p someth@@ ing@@ ).
She explained the meaning and origin of the expres@@ sions, which she referred to as "@@ brid@@ ges to the past@@ ".
To round off the mor@@ ning there was a tom@@ bol@@ a.
The pri@@ zes were plac@@ ed, cover@@ ed, on a table and were hum@@ or@@ ously par@@ ap@@ hra@@ sed prior to being presented to the winn@@ ers.
May@@ or@@ al candidate Roman Wa@@ iz@@ en@@ eg@@ ger was also to be found among the visi@@ tors to the joint break@@ fast.
L@@ earning rather than unemploy@@ ment@@ : Tou@@ rism pilo@@ t project for the un@@ trained
A pilo@@ t project for the touri@@ st industry is being launched today in the Mec@@ kl@@ en@@ burg l@@ ake distric@@ t.
Under the management of the Federal Emp@@ loy@@ ment Agen@@ cy, 4@@ 9 men and women who are already working within the industry as un@@ trained workers, will be trained as qualified ho@@ tel and restau@@ rant staff over the course of three w@@ inter@@ s.
"@@ What@@ 's innovative about it is that the six-@@ month cour@@ ses end with diplom@@ as@@ ," said Carmen Wi@@ ech@@ ert of the Ne@@ ub@@ rand@@ en@@ burg Emp@@ loy@@ ment Agen@@ cy.
There are many benefit@@ s: The participants will not be unemploy@@ ed, the companies receive trained skilled workers, which are in continu@@ ally increasing demand in ho@@ tels and restau@@ ran@@ ts, and the agency will not have to fund unemployment.
Also involved in the project are the Cham@@ ber of In@@ du@@ stry and Com@@ mer@@ ce in Ne@@ ub@@ rand@@ en@@ burg and the German Ho@@ tel and Restau@@ rant Association (@@ Deutsche Ho@@ tel@@ - und Gast@@ stÃ¤@@ t@@ te, D@@ eho@@ ga@@ ) of Mec@@ kl@@ en@@ bur@@ g-@@ Western P@@ omer@@ ani@@ a.
N@@ SA B@@ lam@@ es "@@ In@@ ternal Er@@ ror@@ ," Not Hack@@ ers, For Web@@ site Crash
The shadow@@ y National Security Agency said late Fri@@ day that it was a g@@ lit@@ ch that brought down its public we@@ b@@ site for a few hour@@ s, not hack@@ ers as some claimed on@@ line.
"@@ N@@ SA@@ .@@ go@@ v was not accessible for several hours ton@@ ight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled up@@ dat@@ e@@ ," the sp@@ y agency said in an em@@ ail@@ ed stat@@ ement.
The issue will be resolved this even@@ ing.
C@@ laim@@ s that the ou@@ tage was caused by a distributed denial of service [@@ D@@ Do@@ S@@ ] attack are not true.
Ear@@ lier this ev@@ ening online ser@@ ver tra@@ ck@@ ers noted the N@@ SA@@ 's we@@ b@@ site had been down for at least six hour@@ s, and the site continues to be in@@ accessible for some us@@ ers.
Ear@@ lier an N@@ SA spo@@ kes@@ person told AB@@ C News the agen@@ cy@@ 's intern@@ al, sensitive network was "@@ not at all@@ " compromis@@ ed.
No classi@@ fied information is in dang@@ er, the spo@@ kes@@ person sa@@ id.
At least one hack@@ tiv@@ ist group online claimed that they were responsible for bringing down the N@@ SA site with a D@@ Do@@ S attack.
D@@ Do@@ S attacks are designed to flood a target we@@ b@@ site with traffic until the ser@@ vers are over@@ lo@@ aded and the site collap@@ ses.
The cyber tac@@ tic is a relatively un@@ sophisticated one and the attacks are not meant to penet@@ rate the internal network of the target system.
The form@@ erly sup@@ er secre@@ tive N@@ SA@@ , once ni@@ ck@@ named No Such Agen@@ cy, has found itself in very public light, and amid vicious critic@@ ism, in past months following a stream of revel@@ ations about is vast foreign and domestic surveillance programs - collectively the product of secret N@@ SA fil@@ es stol@@ en from the agency and le@@ aked by disen@@ chan@@ ted former N@@ SA contrac@@ tor Edward Snow@@ den.
Such growing controvers@@ y surrounding the agency prompted early speculation that ton@@ ight@@ 's inci@@ dent was the result of a targeted cyber oper@@ ation.
In October, the number of job@@ less fell slightly by 2@@ 2, to a total of 1,@@ 30@@ 7.
The rate of 3.@@ 1 per cent is indeed better than the previous year and is also better than in September, "@@ however, we had hoped for more@@ ," said Mon@@ ika Fel@@ der-@@ Bau@@ er, acting bran@@ ch manager of the Emp@@ loy@@ ment Agency in Son@@ tho@@ fen.
Several companies have thus far reacted cau@@ ti@@ ously when it comes to hir@@ ing.
St@@ ating a reason for this, Fel@@ der-@@ Bau@@ er sa@@ id@@ : "@@ We have barely any skilled workers in the fields of skilled cra@@ f@@ ts and trad@@ es, health@@ care and geri@@ atri@@ c care@@ ."

Bombardi@@ er profit di@@ ps as plane deliver@@ ies, orders fall
Can@@ adian plane and train mak@@ er Bombardi@@ er In@@ c reported a 15 perc@@ ent fall in net profit on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day, pressu@@ red by fewer aircraft orders and deliver@@ ies in the third quarter and contract issues in its train un@@ it.
Mon@@ tre@@ al-@@ based Bombardi@@ er also did not release any flight test data for its br@@ and-@@ new C@@ Seri@@ es aircraft or offer an up@@ date on whether the plane will meet its ambitious sch@@ ed@@ ule of going into commercial service by next Septem@@ ber.
After the test plan@@ e's in@@ augu@@ ral flight about a month and a half ago, it has only flow@@ n three more times, raising questions over whether the testing phase is on tra@@ ck.
Res@@ ul@@ ts fell short of forecasts and sent shares sli@@ ding more than 8 perc@@ ent on the Tor@@ onto Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change.
Cameron Do@@ erk@@ sen, an analy@@ st with National Bank Finan@@ ci@@ al, lowered his rating to "@@ sector perform@@ " from "@@ out@@ perform@@ " on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day with the view that the stock has limited up@@ side over the next one or two quar@@ ters.
"@@ While the weaker aircraft deliver@@ ies were mostly anticip@@ ated, we are clearly dis@@ appointed by the margin performance in transport@@ ation@@ ," Do@@ erk@@ sen said in a cli@@ ent no@@ te.
We believe that Bombardi@@ er will receive new orders for the C@@ Seri@@ es as the flight test program progres@@ ses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we suspect that the market will become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardi@@ er hopes the C@@ Seri@@ es aircraft family can cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ t it into the low end of a market now dominated by Bo@@ eing and Air@@ bus@@ .
The first test plane was un@@ v@@ ei@@ led in March and took flight for the first time in September after months of del@@ ay@@ s.
But firm orders for the C@@ Seri@@ es are moderate so far at 17@@ 7 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to vali@@ date the comp@@ any@@ 's claims about the new jet@@ lin@@ er@@ 's fuel efficiency and cost savings potential.
There are currently 40@@ 3 total orders and commitments with 15 customers and oper@@ ators.
Chief Executive Off@@ ic@@ er P@@ ier@@ re Be@@ au@@ do@@ in was confident Bombardi@@ er would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first j@@ et is put into commercial use.
Execu@@ tives also reas@@ sured analysts and media on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day the program was progres@@ sing according to sch@@ edu@@ le.
"@@ The test plane did@@ n't stay on the ground longer than anticip@@ at@@ ed@@ ," Be@@ au@@ do@@ in said in a conference call@@ , adding that ground tests and software up@@ d@@ ates were scheduled during the plan@@ e's down@@ time.
Every manufactur@@ er schedul@@ es it in a different way.
We had decided to do a first flight and to do an up@@ date period and that@@ 's what we have done.
That will happen all through the flight program.
The second of five test plan@@ es is expected to take flight in the coming weeks, with the remain@@ der following shor@@ tly af@@ ter, the company sa@@ id.
Still, analysts are skeptical the first custom@@ er can begin operating a C@@ Seri@@ es plane 12 months after its ma@@ iden f@@ light.
Bombardi@@ er said it was evalu@@ ating the ent@@ r@@ y-@@ in@@ to-@@ service (E@@ IS@@ ) sch@@ ed@@ ule and will provide an up@@ date in the next few months.
"@@ This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardi@@ er@@ 's internal sch@@ ed@@ ule apparently - rein@@ forces our view that ent@@ r@@ y-@@ in@@ to-@@ service will be pushed to Q@@ 1@@ /@@ 15@@ ," said Do@@ erk@@ sen.
For the third quarter ended September 3@@ 0, Bombardi@@ er@@ 's net profit fell to $@@ 14@@ 7 million, or 8 cents per shar@@ e, from $@@ 17@@ 2 million, or 9 cents per share a year ear@@ lier@@ .
Ad@@ just@@ ed earnings per share were un@@ changed at 9 cent@@ s.
Re@@ ven@@ ue di@@ pped margin@@ ally to $@@ 4.@@ 1 billion from $@@ 4.@@ 2 billion.
Analy@@ sts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $@@ 4.@@ 5@@ 6 billion, according to Thom@@ son Re@@ u@@ ters I@@ /@@ B@@ /@@ E@@ /@@ S.
The world's four@@ th-@@ largest plan@@ em@@ aker said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quar@@ ter, down from 5@@ 7 a year ear@@ lier@@ .
N@@ et orders fell to 26 air@@ cra@@ ft, from 8@@ 3.
The back@@ lo@@ g in the a@@ ero@@ space division was $3@@ 2.@@ 9 billion as of September 3@@ 0, un@@ changed from December 3@@ 1.
"@@ In a@@ ero@@ space, results were in line with our guid@@ ance, but the low order in@@ take and overall market conditions were a disappoint@@ ment@@ ," Be@@ au@@ do@@ in sa@@ id.
A@@ ero@@ space revenue fell 13 perc@@ ent to $2 billion.
Bombardi@@ er, the world's largest train@@ mak@@ er, said revenue in that division rose nearly 11 perc@@ ent to $@@ 2.@@ 1 billion.
The order back@@ lo@@ g in the transportation unit was $3@@ 2.@@ 6 billion as of September 3@@ 0, up margin@@ ally from December 3@@ 1.
The transportation divi@@ sion@@ 's marg@@ ins were affected by exec@@ ution issues in a few large contrac@@ ts.
Execu@@ tives said new guidance would be provided in the fourth quar@@ ter.
Shar@@ es of Bombardi@@ er, which also announced that Google In@@ c Chief Financial Off@@ ic@@ er Patri@@ ck P@@ ich@@ ette would join the bo@@ ard, were down 8.@@ 5 perc@@ ent at C@@ $@@ 4.@@ 8@@ 3 in m@@ id after@@ no@@ on trading on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day.

Co@@ c@@ ain@@ e-@@ addic@@ t lawy@@ er who ti@@ pped off M@@ r Big about police investigation is jail@@ ed
Bas@@ har@@ at D@@ it@@ ta, 4@@ 2, would feed information to crime l@@ ord N@@ eil S@@ carb@@ rough
The so@@ lic@@ it@@ or feared his secret drug addic@@ tion would be exposed
Was given a three-@@ year prison sent@@ ence at Li@@ ver@@ pool C@@ rown Court
A top def@@ ence lawy@@ er who told a drugs M@@ r Big about a major police investig@@ ation, because he feared his secret drug addic@@ tion would be ex@@ pos@@ ed, has been jail@@ ed for three years.
Bas@@ har@@ at D@@ it@@ ta, 4@@ 2, would feed sensitive intelligence to crime l@@ ord N@@ eil S@@ carb@@ rough about in@@ qui@@ ries into his drug traffick@@ ing activities after he became com@@ promised by his coc@@ ain@@ e hab@@ it.
The so@@ lic@@ it@@ or, who was ni@@ ck@@ named "@@ Bash@@ " and ha@@ iled by criminals as a "@@ top brief@@ ," was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough@@ , who he had represented in a previous nar@@ co@@ tics tri@@ al.
Off@@ ic@@ ers spot@@ ted Sar@@ bor@@ ough@@ , 3@@ 2, dro@@ pping off three bag@@ s of coc@@ ain@@ e at the lawy@@ er@@ 's home in B@@ lack@@ bur@@ n, L@@ anc@@ as@@ hi@@ re, while he was out at a Law Society d@@ inner with colleagu@@ es.
In@@ qui@@ ries revealed D@@ it@@ ta was a "@@ regular us@@ er@@ " of the C@@ lass A drug after tests found tra@@ ces of coc@@ ain@@ e in his ha@@ ir, on his wal@@ let and on his credit car@@ ds.
Over an eight month period between January and August 2011 he sought to illi@@ c@@ itly obtain information on the arres@@ ts of two men on behalf of S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough as well as one of his associ@@ ates.
All four suspec@@ ts were being watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a hero@@ in and coc@@ ain@@ e ra@@ ck@@ et operating across L@@ anc@@ as@@ hi@@ re, C@@ um@@ bri@@ a, Mer@@ se@@ ysi@@ de, Ber@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and West Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re.
They and 32 other men were later jail@@ ed after police seized hero@@ in and coc@@ ain@@ e worth Â£@@ 1.@@ 5@@ million along with more than Â£@@ 200@@ ,000 in cash during a series of ra@@ id@@ s.
D@@ it@@ ta, 4@@ 2, fed information to criminals because of fears his coc@@ ain@@ e addic@@ tion would be exposed
Toda@@ y at Li@@ ver@@ pool C@@ rown Court D@@ it@@ ta, who works at law firm For@@ bes So@@ lic@@ it@@ ors, based in B@@ lack@@ bur@@ n, was facing dis@@ gra@@ ce after being found guilty of two counts of per@@ ver@@ ting the course of justice following a three week trial at Li@@ ver@@ pool C@@ rown Cour@@ t.
He admitted coc@@ ain@@ e poss@@ ession at an earlier hear@@ ing.
The lawy@@ er@@ 's down@@ fall came after police investig@@ ating S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough discovered he had been in regular phone cont@@ act with D@@ it@@ ta in February 2011.
Two detec@@ tives tra@@ iled the suspect and spot@@ ted him arri@@ ving at D@@ it@@ ta@@ 's house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a p@@ urity of 60 per cent under the lawy@@ er@@ 's b@@ ins in a black gol@@ f glo@@ ve.
So@@ on after the drop off, S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough was in regular phone cont@@ act with D@@ it@@ ta who had been out at the d@@ inner at the B@@ lack@@ bur@@ n R@@ over@@ s football stadi@@ um, E@@ wo@@ od Park@@ .
The lawy@@ er returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them.
The court heard D@@ it@@ ta was a "@@ regular us@@ er@@ " of coc@@ ain@@ e after tests found tra@@ ces of the C@@ lass A drug in his ha@@ ir, wal@@ let and on his credit car@@ ds
D@@ it@@ ta was arrested later but denied using coc@@ ain@@ e and and said he had been speaking to the suspected de@@ aler because he was his cli@@ ent and argued their discussions were subject to "@@ legal privile@@ ge@@ ."
During his arrest D@@ it@@ ta picked up his wal@@ let and tried to remove several credit car@@ ds but they were all seized and a ha@@ ir s@@ ample was taken fo@@ m him.
In a police inter@@ view he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and cli@@ ents would call at his house on legal business.
But the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain@@ , some of whom he had previously represent@@ ed, after key arres@@ ts to tell them what detec@@ tives knew about them.
Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ing, An@@ ne Wh@@ y@@ te sa@@ id@@ : "@@ If anyone should know not to the break the law, it is a criminal so@@ lic@@ it@@ or@@ ."
M@@ r D@@ it@@ ta is accused of ab@@ using his position as a criminal so@@ lic@@ it@@ or, having become too involved with specific cli@@ ents.
The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug deal@@ er, but a drug de@@ aler providing his own lawy@@ er with drug@@ s.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawy@@ er.
But this went way beyond the ordinary confin@@ es of a lawy@@ er-@@ cli@@ ent relationship.
He th@@ war@@ ted the polic@@ e's investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities.
M@@ r D@@ it@@ ta was not hon@@ our@@ ing his profession@@ , but dish@@ on@@ our@@ ing it.
He got too close to certain cli@@ ents, in particular S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough@@ , and he allowed his independence to be compromis@@ ed.
D@@ it@@ ta denied wrong@@ doing and claim@@ ed: "@@ If I was a corrupt lawy@@ er, which I am not, and I wanted to feed information to M@@ r S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough@@ , I would not wait 15 hour@@ s, I would do it immedi@@ at@@ el@@ y@@ ."
But after the hearing Sup@@ t Lee Hal@@ ste@@ ad from L@@ anc@@ ash@@ ire Poli@@ ce sa@@ id@@ : "@@ M@@ r D@@ it@@ ta turned from criminal so@@ lic@@ it@@ or to a criminal himself the moment he started ob@@ taining drugs from organis@@ ed crimin@@ al@@ s@@ ."
His addic@@ tion to coc@@ ain@@ e left him hop@@ eless@@ ly com@@ promised and vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organis@@ ed crime groups who t@@ asked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investig@@ ations.
So@@ lic@@ it@@ ors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should in@@ sti@@ l trust and confidence in the public.
M@@ r D@@ it@@ ta has betra@@ yed this trust and attempted to hide behind the ven@@ e@@ er of his profession@@ .
L@@ anc@@ as@@ hi@@ re@@ 's Seri@@ ous and Organis@@ ed Cri@@ me Un@@ it led the investigation into M@@ r D@@ it@@ ta which has also seen him convic@@ ted of three counts of poss@@ ession of coc@@ ain@@ e and now per@@ ver@@ ting the course of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and put you before the cour@@ ts.
S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough himself was jail@@ ed for 14 years after p@@ leading guilty to conspiracy to supply hero@@ in, coc@@ ain@@ e and c@@ annab@@ is.
Thir@@ ty five other men involved in the ra@@ ck@@ et were jail@@ ed for a total of 15@@ 3 years for drugs off@@ ences.
On his we@@ b@@ site D@@ it@@ ta gave a question and answer s@@ ession about himself in which he says his fantas@@ y job would be a lawy@@ er representing cli@@ ents on De@@ ath Ro@@ w in America, his ultimate d@@ inner gu@@ est as being Mohammed Ali and inequality as his motivation for work.

Has@@ l@@ ach@@ : S@@ cep@@ tic@@ ism visi@@ bly gives way to confidence
The 2015 Par@@ ish Council elections will bring about fundamental change, for example in the Has@@ la@@ ch P@@ ast@@ or@@ al C@@ are Un@@ it (@@ Seel@@ sor@@ geein@@ heit Has@@ l@@ ach, SE@@ ).
There will then only be one joint Par@@ ish Council for all six par@@ ish@@ es.
In a joint meeting on Sat@@ ur@@ day, the committe@@ es from Has@@ l@@ ach, H@@ of@@ st@@ et@@ ten, MÃ¼@@ hl@@ en@@ bach@@ , Fisch@@ erb@@ ach, St@@ ein@@ ach and Wel@@ schen@@ st@@ ein@@ ach prepared for the changes.
This is because there are no further changes to be made to the fundamental decisions of the di@@ oc@@ ese and it is up to the Par@@ ish Counc@@ ils to implement these in as satisfac@@ tory a manner possible.
During the course of the day one thing became particularly clear: the sc@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism towards the new system is reluct@@ antly yet visi@@ bly giving way to confidence.
The extremely constructive discussions between the six committe@@ es and the full-@@ time members of the pa@@ stor@@ al care team addressed top@@ ics ranging from perceptions and expectations regarding the 2015 reforms, to concrete proposals regarding the future composition and size of the Par@@ ish Council.
Region@@ al De@@ an Geor@@ g Sch@@ mit@@ t explained the newly draw@@ n@@ -up guid@@ elines for pa@@ stor@@ al care units in the arch@@ -@@ di@@ oc@@ ese of Frei@@ burg with the help of a pres@@ ent@@ ation.
According to the guid@@ el@@ ines, the S@@ E Has@@ l@@ ach, as a ch@@ urch community, will be a corpor@@ ation under public law, which sh@@ all assume the rights and obligations of the six individual ch@@ urch communities.
There will then only be one joint Par@@ ish Council and a Foundation Council, in which the rec@@ tor will be represented by virtu@@ e of his office.
From each par@@ ish@@ , at least two elected members are to be represent@@ ed, with so-called ch@@ urch community teams set up on-@@ site in the six par@@ ish@@ es.
In future their task will be to promote ch@@ urch life on a local basis.
Regar@@ ding the issue of the finances of the individual par@@ ish@@ es, the need for extensive discussion became evi@@ d@@ ent.
The reforms plan for the accumulated assets in the par@@ ish@@ es to be re@@ tained for a speci@@ fied purpo@@ se.
Ac@@ counts pay@@ able, on the other hand, will be passed over to the "@@ ch@@ urch communit@@ y" as a whole.
In particular, planned major investments, the debts from which thus affect all par@@ ish@@ es, were cause for great concern.
"@@ In the past, investments were only made in projects that could be managed by the individual par@@ ish@@ es by themsel@@ ves@@ ," said Has@@ l@@ ach@@ 's Par@@ ish Council Chairman Brun@@ o Prin@@ z@@ bach@@ .
Bar@@ bar R@@ it@@ ter, Cha@@ ir of the Committee in the Sch@@ ut@@ ter@@ wal@@ d-@@ Neu@@ ried pa@@ stor@@ al care un@@ it, has practical experience of a joint committee for five par@@ ish@@ es.
In 2006 she set her@@ self the tas@@ k, "@@ Bec@@ ome one, remain fi@@ ve@@ " and came to reali@@ se that the task is really not that simp@@ le.
The Committe@@ es of the Has@@ la@@ ch pa@@ stor@@ al care unit set out to answer questions regarding the future composition and size of the joint Par@@ ish Council, and the practical work of the ch@@ urch community team@@ s.
The specific details will be confirmed in subsequent meetings and decided in an additional joint meeting of all six committe@@ es in the coming spr@@ ing.
At the end, Par@@ ish Coun@@ sell@@ or Michael SchÃ¶n@@ er from St@@ ein@@ ach presented the new lo@@ go of the pa@@ stor@@ al care un@@ it, which was agreed on by a clear majority.
Elec@@ tric@@ ity to become more expensive in P@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f
The citizens of P@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f will have to adjust to high electricity costs.
As Man@@ aging Director of the municipal energy company, J@@ Ã¶r@@ g-@@ Ar@@ ne Bi@@ as, confirmed to the S@@ Ã@@ D@@ K@@ U@@ RI@@ ER@@ , families of four in P@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f will be on the receiving end of a price increase of EU@@ R 70 to 90 per year.
One major reason for the upcoming price increase is the rise of the so-called E@@ EC Lev@@ y from 5.@@ 27@@ 7 to 6.@@ 3 C@@ ents per kil@@ ow@@ at@@ t hour@@ .
This le@@ vy will be res@@ et by the four oper@@ ators of the large power gri@@ ds, in October of each year.
They estimate the additional costs they will inc@@ ur as a result of the "@@ energy tur@@ n@@ aro@@ und@@ ", which they will be able to recover by means of a le@@ vy on the price of electric@@ ity.
The P@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f municipal energy company forms the last link in this chain@@ .
In its projec@@ tions, the supervisory coun@@ cil of the energy company even assumed a le@@ vy higher than that reported by J@@ Ã¶r@@ g-@@ Ar@@ ne Bi@@ as.
The specific figures must now be calculated before the municipal energy c@@ mp@@ any can in@@ form its customers of the precise price increase next week@@ .
"@@ We are working on the assumption of an increase of 1 cent plus x@@ ," said Bi@@ as, with the figure likely to be closer to 2 cent@@ s.
Tra@@ ff@@ ic lights permanently re@@ d: ob@@ serve waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light simply never turns gre@@ en.
The cont@@ act lo@@ op on the road does not reac@@ t, or the light itself is defec@@ tive.
What should you do - drive through on red@@ ?
If an affected person has wa@@ ited for a sufficiently long period of time at a red light, and provided the cross@@ ing is clear, they can drive on, explained St@@ ut@@ t@@ gar@@ t-@@ based lawy@@ er R@@ al@@ f Bec@@ ker in "@@ Mo@@ tor@@ rad@@ " (@@ Mo@@ tor@@ cy@@ cle@@ ) maga@@ zin@@ e.
The waiting time mu@@ st, however, be "@@ appropri@@ ate@@ ", which can be interpreted differently on a cas@@ e-@@ to-@@ case basis.
Bec@@ ker advis@@ es that you wait at least five min@@ utes before a fault with the traffic lights can be assum@@ ed.
Anyone who drives on in sp@@ ite of a red light mu@@ st, however, be aware that he@@ /@@ she will be fully li@@ able for any resulting accid@@ ent.
Anyone who wa@@ its for less than five min@@ utes has, under certain circumstances, not wa@@ ited long enough, warned B@@ eck@@ er, refer@@ ring to a ruling of the Ham@@ m Higher Region@@ al Cour@@ t.
In the case in question, a driver ignored a light that was permanently red after around three min@@ utes and and was held responsible for neg@@ lig@@ ently jump@@ ing a red light.
The traffic lights were actually not defec@@ tive, but rather turned green just a few min@@ utes later.
He was spar@@ ed a driving ban on account of the special circumstances - but was not spar@@ ed a fin@@ e.
T@@ own Council de@@ ligh@@ ted with solid budget
Every time discussion in T@@ own Council meetings turns to the budget, May@@ or R@@ al@@ ph Ger@@ ster has good reason to sm@@ i@@ le.
The municip@@ ality coff@@ ers in Her@@ d@@ wan@@ gen-@@ SchÃ¶n@@ ach are well stock@@ ed and the administration has been debt-@@ free since 2005.
In this sense, this the 2012 budgetary year, can also be recorded as a complete success.
This became clear upon pres@@ entation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As An@@ dre@@ a Ro@@ th@@ m@@ und expla@@ in@@ ed, the administrative budget came in at more than EU@@ R one million higher than originally plan@@ ned, at around 7.@@ 6 million Euro.
The administrative budget surplus, at around EU@@ R 1.@@ 8 million, also stood at around EU@@ R one million above projec@@ tions.
The surplus is primarily due to higher trade tax income and the local authori@@ ti@@ es' contribution towards income tax@@ .
The capital budget also stood well above the projected values.
Instead of the projected EU@@ R 1.5 million Euro, the value for last year was EU@@ R 2.5 million.
"@@ This is mainly due to the higher contribution from the administrative budget@@ ," said Ro@@ th@@ m@@ und.
Because fewer investments were made in the 2012 budgetary year than plan@@ ned, the reserves also came in higher.
In tot@@ al, they managed to increase the general contin@@ gency reserves by around EU@@ R 2.@@ 1 million, to a total of EU@@ R 4.@@ 9 million.
May@@ or R@@ al@@ ph Ger@@ ster th@@ ank@@ ed Ro@@ th@@ m@@ und and its team for the good work.
"@@ A job like this is not something you achieve over@@ night@@ ," said Ger@@ ster in pra@@ ise of the annual financial stat@@ ement.
He and the T@@ own Counc@@ ill@@ ors are clearly de@@ ligh@@ ted with the good fig@@ ures.
It may sound like a paradox@@ , but it is precisely these good figures that could soon work out expensive for the citizens.
In the past, a good financial situation meant that the local authorities could do away with high municipal rates.
However, according to Ger@@ ster, from time to time this has resulted in subsidies being reduced by the state.
There are prerequi@@ sites that must be fulfill@@ ed in order to receive these subsidies from various compensation el@@ ements.
Among other require@@ ments, the tow@@ ns and municip@@ alities applying for the subsidies must le@@ vy certain municipal rates.

Having been a sing@@ er for 60 years, Hu@@ bert Wer@@ m@@ ter@@ 's story with the C@@ Ã¤@@ cili@@ a M@@ ale Ch@@ or@@ al Society is almost twice as long as that of the Aut@@ um@@ n Fes@@ tiv@@ al, during which he was cerem@@ oni@@ ally hon@@ ou@@ red.
As per usu@@ al, Hu@@ bert Wer@@ m@@ ter stood on the stage in the c@@ olo@@ urs of his male voice cho@@ ir@@ .
Even after 60 years he still finds great pleas@@ ure from sing@@ ing with the cho@@ ir, which has achieved much more than popularity during this period.
Wer@@ m@@ ter has also been active within the associ@@ ation, serving as a member of the committee for 28 years, among other ro@@ les.
For his commitment and loyalty to the organis@@ ation, he has also received several awar@@ d@@ s: J@@ Ã¶r@@ g Ko@@ hr@@ , L@@ ay P@@ ast@@ or acting on behalf of the C@@ Ã¤@@ cili@@ an Association of Ro@@ t@@ ten@@ bur@@ g-@@ St@@ ut@@ t@@ gar@@ t, presented him with an Association C@@ er@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate and a letter of commen@@ d@@ ation signed by Bis@@ ho@@ p Geb@@ hard FÃ¼r@@ st - the cho@@ ir also serves as a ch@@ urch cho@@ ir@@ .
His cho@@ ir colleagues presented him with a German Ch@@ or@@ al Association cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate and an en@@ gra@@ ved pe@@ w@@ ter pl@@ ate.
Asi@@ de from hon@@ our@@ ing Hu@@ go, the 3@@ 1@@ st Aut@@ um@@ n Fes@@ tiv@@ al progres@@ sed as us@@ ual@@ : Al@@ ong@@ side the Bet@@ ra M@@ ale Vo@@ ice Cho@@ ir, the Sal@@ z@@ st@@ etten Ch@@ or@@ al Cl@@ ub@@ , the B@@ ais@@ ingen Ch@@ or@@ al Di@@ vision and the Lo@@ cal Musi@@ c Soci@@ et@@ y, the Voll@@ mar@@ ingen sing@@ ers delivered a c@@ olo@@ ur@@ ful bl@@ end of different ch@@ or@@ al and son@@ g sty@@ les, which entertain@@ ed the 400 or so visi@@ tors.
The Voll@@ mar@@ ingen M@@ ale Vo@@ ice Cho@@ ir got things running with atmo@@ sph@@ eric son@@ gs such as "@@ Im W@@ ein@@ par@@ a@@ dies@@ " and "@@ L@@ us@@ tig, ihr BrÃ¼@@ der@@ ".
They had also prepared a short ser@@ en@@ ade as a tri@@ bute to their hon@@ or@@ ary sing@@ er Hu@@ bert Wer@@ m@@ ter - Wolfgang Ama@@ de@@ us Mo@@ zar@@ t@@ 's "@@ Bundes@@ li@@ ed@@ ".
The Bet@@ ra M@@ ale Vo@@ ice Cho@@ ir also s@@ ang classic ch@@ or@@ al piec@@ es such as "@@ J@@ Ã¤@@ ger@@ wer@@ ben@@ " by Juli@@ us Wen@@ ger@@ t, "@@ Wei@@ t, weit weg@@ " by Hu@@ bert Go@@ is@@ ern and the fol@@ k son@@ g "@@ W@@ ann du durch@@ geh@@ st durch@@ s Tal@@ ".
With its mixed cho@@ ir and its la@@ dies@@ ' ens@@ em@@ ble - the "@@ Impul@@ sch@@ or@@ " (@@ Impulse Cho@@ ir@@ ), the Sal@@ z@@ st@@ etten Ch@@ or@@ al Club ensu@@ red that the female quo@@ ta was fulfill@@ ed at the fes@@ tiv@@ al.
The mixed cho@@ ir carried li@@ sten@@ ers away to foreign lands with the Ne@@ a@@ poli@@ tan fol@@ k@@ son@@ gs "@@ S@@ anta Lu@@ ci@@ a@@ " and "@@ Evi@@ va E@@ sp@@ an@@ a@@ " by An@@ tos G@@ us, while the "@@ Impul@@ sch@@ or@@ " also drew on foreign langu@@ ag@@ es: "@@ Liber@@ ati@@ o@@ " and "@@ H@@ ey Ju@@ de@@ " were included on their programm@@ e.
The Ch@@ or@@ al Di@@ vision of the B@@ ais@@ ingen S@@ ports Club returned to its home ground with "@@ Was isch der Sch@@ wo@@ b@@ ?" by H@@ ans S@@ Ã¼s@@ s@@ mu@@ th and Robert Pap@@ pert@@ 's "@@ B@@ ier@@ li@@ ed@@ ", while the Voll@@ mar@@ ingen Musi@@ c Society provided the crow@@ ning musi@@ cal conclu@@ sion.
For children, there was a small au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary programme - "@@ O@@ ma Han@@ ne@@ " (@@ Gr@@ and@@ ma Han@@ ne@@ ), a@@ .@@ k@@ .@@ a H@@ ann@@ el@@ ore St@@ oll@@ stei@@ mer, performed a '@@ Kas@@ per@@ l@@ ' the@@ ater (@@ similar to P@@ un@@ ch and Jud@@ y) and read some st@@ ories, which kept the children entertain@@ ed throughout the after@@ no@@ on.
Chil@@ d@@ ren@@ 's dreams come true
Over the next few days, the nur@@ ser@@ y schools and day care cent@@ res in Zoll@@ ern@@ al@@ b distric@@ t will be receiving ma@@ il.
The Schwar@@ zw@@ Ã¤l@@ der Bo@@ te (@@ Black For@@ est Her@@ al@@ d@@ ), in collaboration with Bau@@ haus and the Spar@@ kas@@ se Zoll@@ ern@@ al@@ b S@@ av@@ ings Bank, would like to support the institutions in gran@@ ting their construction and ren@@ ov@@ ation wish@@ es.
Does the nur@@ ser@@ y school need a new s@@ and box@@ ?
All nur@@ seri@@ es, day care cent@@ res and c@@ r@@ Ã©@@ ches from across the entire Zoll@@ ern@@ al@@ b distric@@ t can become involved in the campaign.
If they have a construction or ren@@ ov@@ ation request for their institu@@ tion, they can regi@@ ster this with the Schwar@@ zw@@ Ã¤l@@ der Bo@@ te.
G@@ et creative with your children and surprise the jud@@ ging panel of the Kinder@@ gar@@ ten-@@ Bau@@ stelle (N@@ ur@@ ser@@ y Scho@@ ol@@ -@@ Con@@ struc@@ tion Sit@@ e) campaign.

Keny@@ an press ou@@ trag@@ ed at controversial media law
"@@ It is a fri@@ ghten@@ ing place, and it is vali@@ d to ask@@ : what is there to prevent Parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow@@ ?" the paper said, challenging the bill as un@@ constitu@@ tion@@ al.
"@@ This law is dra@@ con@@ ian and very p@@ uni@@ tive and we reject it@@ ," said Cy@@ rus Kam@@ au, managing director for Capital Group - home to Capit@@ al@@ F@@ M@@ , one of Keny@@ a's most respected independent radi@@ o st@@ ations and news we@@ b@@ si@@ tes.
He said the new media tri@@ bunal "@@ will always be bias@@ ed because it@@ 's an extension of the government@@ ," and that restrictions on content and adverti@@ sing would damage Keny@@ a's place in the global economy.
"@@ I hope the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the MP@@ s@@ ," he sa@@ id.
According to The St@@ ar newspap@@ er, the new bill will effectively hand the government "@@ a stran@@ g@@ le@@ hold over the medi@@ a@@ ," while The Standard said democracy and free speech in Kenya had been "@@ dealt a major blow@@ " and lam@@ b@@ ast@@ ed the bill as "@@ dra@@ con@@ i@@ an@@ ."
The passing of the bill comes amid a str@@ ing of measures to reinforce national security in the wake of the Septem@@ ber@@ 's attack by Islamist gun@@ men on the West@@ g@@ ate sh@@ opping m@@ all.
Kenya media drew the ire of authorities by broadcast@@ ing security cam@@ era foo@@ tage of troops who were disp@@ at@@ ched to the scene of the attack pur@@ por@@ tedly ro@@ b@@ bing the up@@ market m@@ all.
Poli@@ ce chief David Ki@@ ma@@ i@@ yo reacted by sum@@ mon@@ ing two journalists and a media executive for question@@ ing, although the sum@@ mon@@ s was re@@ tracted following a media out@@ c@@ ry.
Under the new bill@@ , media houses can be fin@@ ed up to 20 million Keny@@ an sh@@ ill@@ ings and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being "@@ de-@@ list@@ ed@@ ," or bar@@ red from receiving official press ac@@ credi@@ t@@ ation.
The tri@@ bunal also has the power to seize the property of an offen@@ der if a fine is not pa@@ id.
According to the Dail@@ y N@@ ation, "@@ even one fine is enough to cri@@ pp@@ le most F@@ M st@@ ations@@ ."
It also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as Keny@@ a's "@@ liv@@ ely blo@@ go@@ sp@@ here@@ ."
By sil@@ encing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they like with imp@@ unity.
"@@ No one will ever know@@ ," wrote Nation journalist Mut@@ um@@ a Ma@@ th@@ i@@ u, descri@@ bing the Keny@@ an media as a key source of checks and balances in public life.
"@@ Left to themselves, politicians would bankrup@@ t the country and take us back to h@@ unting and gather@@ ing@@ ," he wro@@ te.
Keny@@ an law@@ makers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May they voted to over@@ turn cuts ordered by the national salaries commission and rein@@ state their hef@@ ty salaries of around 5@@ 3@@ 2,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings a month tax@@ -@@ free - ranked among the highest in the world.
B@@ ad-@@ DÃ¼r@@ r@@ heim@@ : A dream comes true for the F@@ C
The official in@@ augu@@ ral cerem@@ ony for the ast@@ ro@@ -@@ tur@@ f sports field did not wan@@ e in significance for the town and the football club@@ , in sp@@ ite of the cold weather and ra@@ in.
Everyone had hoped for more pleas@@ ant conditions for the cerem@@ ony last Sat@@ ur@@ day, however the weather go@@ ds chose not to cooper@@ ate.
So anyone who came without an um@@ br@@ ell@@ a, or for whatever reason could not hold onto one, drew the short stra@@ w.
This was the case for the musi@@ cians who accompanied the cerem@@ on@@ y, as well as for a number of speak@@ ers.
Thus, F@@ C Chairman Al@@ bre@@ cht Schl@@ enk@@ er, who spoke of the ful@@ fil@@ ment of a dre@@ am, also got fairly w@@ et.
His thanks went first and foremo@@ st to May@@ or W@@ alter Kl@@ um@@ pp@@ , who was heavily involved in the re@@ alis@@ ation of the project, the T@@ own Council, the companies involved and clu@@ b members who played a part.
Par@@ ticul@@ ar mention went out to Lo@@ th@@ ar Hel@@ d, Paul Wei@@ zen@@ eg@@ ger, H@@ einer G@@ ail and Peter Gra@@ f.
The sp@@ ry pension@@ ers laid 400 square met@@ res of flag@@ ging for the new path@@ s.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also hon@@ ou@@ red by M@@ ember of the State Parliament@@ , Karl Rom@@ bach@@ .
Fur@@ ther words of gre@@ eting were issued to the town S@@ ports Commission@@ er, Hu@@ bert Ba@@ ier, the Di@@ strict Chair@@ person of the Southern B@@ aden Fo@@ ot@@ ball Associ@@ ation, Kun@@ o K@@ ay@@ an, and Fri@@ edri@@ ch K@@ nor@@ r from the planning office, who announced a don@@ ation to the club@@ 's youth divi@@ sion.
May@@ or Kl@@ ump@@ p rec@@ alled that wea@@ ther@@ -@@ related influ@@ ences in the Spring and Aut@@ um@@ n had repeatedly afflic@@ ted the original sports fiel@@ d, to such an extent that it could not be played on.
It was way back 15 years ago that solutions to the problem were first consider@@ ed, when the construction of a third pit@@ ch on the football clu@@ b site or at the secondary school on Sal@@ in@@ en@@ see L@@ ake were consider@@ ed.
Both ideas were rejec@@ ted.
Si@@ x years ago, though@@ ts turned to laying an ast@@ ro@@ -@@ tur@@ f pit@@ ch, which was generally viewed as the perfect solution.
Speci@@ fic plans were drawn up two years ago, when the F@@ C inherited the Sch@@ ab@@ el@@ stu@@ be in le@@ as@@ ehol@@ d, promised a contribution of EU@@ R 100,000 for the construction of the pit@@ ch and the state approved a subsidy of EU@@ R 10@@ 4,@@ 00@@ 0.
In October 2012, the T@@ own Council decided to cover the remaining EU@@ R 3@@ 5@@ 6@@ ,000 of the total cost of EU@@ R 5@@ 60@@ ,00@@ 0, summ@@ ar@@ ised Kl@@ um@@ pp@@ .
Wor@@ k began on the 6@@ 8 x 10@@ 8 met@@ re ast@@ ro@@ -@@ tur@@ f pit@@ ch on 4 Jun@@ e.
During the construction phas@@ e, which lasted over three months, 3@@ ,000 c@@ ub@@ ic met@@ res of earth were remo@@ ved, of which half was used for the laying of a dir@@ t bi@@ ke tra@@ ck.
Union and SP@@ D have continued their coalition negotiations, addressing the top@@ ics of internal affairs and justice.
To this end, the compet@@ ent working group met this mor@@ ning.
Among other issues, top@@ ics discussed included direct democracy, the bri@@ ber@@ y of MP@@ s and the Federal Poli@@ ce.
During the mor@@ ning, the Migration and Integration working group also sought to continue its discus@@ sions.
Among the issues to be addressed was that of dual nation@@ ality, in which regard both sides have opposing ideas.
The SP@@ D would like to put an end to the pressure placed on immigrant children to decide on one nation@@ ality - the Union rejec@@ ts the notion of a dual pas@@ spor@@ t.
Regar@@ ding the subject of traff@@ ic, which was not on the agenda for this Fri@@ day, the SP@@ D substanti@@ ated its opposition to a car toll charge promoted by the CS@@ U@@ .
A toll road sti@@ cker would amount to a "@@ flat rate fe@@ e for frequent drivers and would thus be environmentally counter@@ productiv@@ e@@ ," explained the SP@@ D negoti@@ ator for issues rel@@ ating to traff@@ ic, Flori@@ an P@@ ron@@ old, in a letter to his parliamentary group@@ .
There would be a threat of diver@@ ted traffic on country roads, which are already accident ho@@ ts@@ po@@ ts.
The introduction of a toll for cars would also only be a first step@@ , in P@@ ron@@ ol@@ d@@ 's ey@@ es.
"@@ There is the risk that the compensation for Germans would be aboli@@ shed at a later point in time@@ ," he sa@@ id.

Vienn@@ a Air@@ port aboli@@ sh@@ es passen@@ ger call@@ -@@ outs
Mr. Ma@@ x Ma@@ ier, ple@@ ase make your way to G@@ ate 2@@ 4.
In future, announc@@ ements such as this will no longer happen at Vienn@@ a International Air@@ por@@ t.
The majority of lo@@ ud@@ spe@@ aker announc@@ ements will c@@ ease - thus considerably reducing the no@@ ise level.
The goal of this adjustment is to create a more relax@@ ing atmosp@@ here.
As air@@ port spo@@ kes@@ person Peter K@@ le@@ em@@ an announced to Radi@@ o Vienn@@ a that in adjust@@ ing the approach towards announc@@ ements, Vienn@@ a Air@@ port is following an international trend.
Among others, the air@@ ports in Kopenha@@ gen, Frankfur@@ t and Dubai have already done away with the no@@ is@@ y call@@ -@@ out@@ s.
By doing away with these announc@@ ements - on average around 200 personal call@@ -@@ outs come through the lo@@ ud@@ speak@@ ers per day - the atmosphere in the air@@ port should be cal@@ mer in future.
"@@ Experi@@ ence has also shown that these individual announc@@ ements are relatively sel@@ dom taken notice of, and at the same time, all other information regarding changes to departure g@@ ates or flight times are somewhat lost among them@@ ," said K@@ le@@ em@@ an while ch@@ at@@ ting to the radi@@ o broadcast@@ er.
High@@ land G@@ ames in Kal@@ ten@@ h@@ of
Al@@ ong@@ side bra@@ ke van pul@@ ling with trac@@ tors, there will also be a second contest at the agricultural autum@@ n fes@@ tiv@@ al at Kal@@ ten@@ h@@ of from 6 to 8 Septem@@ ber.
On Sat@@ ur@@ day 7 September, the High@@ land G@@ ames will start at 1@@ :@@ 30 p@@ .@@ m.
While they are of course a Scot@@ tish tradi@@ tion, they have been given a touch of Sw@@ ab@@ ian col@@ our at the Kal@@ ten@@ h@@ of event ground@@ s.
Teams and individual competitors will be pit@@ ted against one another in the discipl@@ ines of to@@ ss@@ ing the c@@ aber, hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e to@@ ss@@ ing and bu@@ ck@@ et car@@ ry@@ ing.
The c@@ aber is four and a half met@@ res long and weigh@@ s 25 to 30 kil@@ om@@ et@@ res.
"@@ It is@@ n't about the dist@@ anc@@ e@@ ," explains organis@@ er Peter S@@ ai@@ le.
The lo@@ g must be thrown ver@@ tic@@ ally, som@@ ers@@ ault once and then fin@@ ish lying stra@@ igh@@ t.
This scores maximum poin@@ ts.
In to@@ ss@@ ing the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e, it all comes down to acc@@ ura@@ cy.
Hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ es are thrown onto a pe@@ g from a distance of eight met@@ res.
Parti@@ cip@@ ants must then prove their skill and strength by carrying a bu@@ ck@@ et of water 50 met@@ res.
Time is recorded and water quantity measured in a v@@ at at the end.
Two members of each "@@ c@@ lan@@ " or team can then take part in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual con@@ tests receive pri@@ z@@ es.
Teams can practice from 10@@ :@@ 00 a@@ .@@ m.
Su@@ itable clo@@ thing is desirable - for example competitors can we@@ ar kil@@ ts.
However, Sw@@ ab@@ ian traditional clo@@ thing is also per@@ mit@@ ted.
The jud@@ ging panel will also a@@ ward a few bon@@ us points for "@@ out@@ fit@@ s@@ ".
Regi@@ stration is open until a few hours prior to the beginning of the competition.
With the Scot@@ ti@@ sh@@ -S@@ w@@ ab@@ ian High@@ land G@@ ames and the trac@@ tor pul@@ ling con@@ tes@@ t, which will begin half an hour befor@@ eh@@ and, there promises to be a great deal of action at the event grounds on Sat@@ ur@@ day.
In the even@@ ing, f@@ ans of bra@@ ss band musi@@ c will be in for a treat of their own.
At 19@@ :@@ 00@@ , the "@@ bi@@ rab@@ Ã¶@@ h@@ mi@@ sch@@ e" (a play on words all@@ u@@ ding to the regions pe@@ ar tre@@ es, Bo@@ h@@ emi@@ a, and perhaps their love of be@@ er as well@@ !@@ ) wind musi@@ c group from Sch@@ Ã¶@@ m@@ ber@@ g, provide a great ev@@ ening of entertain@@ ment.
The band plays liv@@ ely pol@@ kas and mar@@ ch@@ es.
However, their re@@ per@@ to@@ ire also includes emo@@ tive wal@@ tz@@ es and a full big band sound@@ .
H@@ ein@@ z K@@ och from Wei@@ len unter den R@@ innen will also be there, better known as the '@@ sing@@ ing inn keep@@ er and black s@@ aus@@ age bar@@ on@@ ".
In the past, he has appeared at the Christ@@ mas market in Dor@@ n@@ han and the Nar@@ ren@@ zun@@ ft (@@ Fo@@ ol@@ 's Gu@@ il@@ d event@@ ).
On Sun@@ day, the L@@ ein@@ st@@ etten Musi@@ c Society will enter@@ tain audi@@ ences with a mor@@ ning s@@ ession, with the B@@ Ã¶ff@@ ingen Far@@ mer@@ 's B@@ and as gu@@ ests from 2@@ :@@ 00 p@@ .@@ m@@ ., and then the "@@ Ol@@ dies@@ " will bring the celeb@@ rations to a clo@@ se.
The celeb@@ rations will get under way on Fri@@ day, with the "@@ St@@ oppel@@ ack@@ er@@ " (@@ St@@ ub@@ ble F@@ iel@@ d@@ ) party feat@@ uring D@@ J R@@ al@@ f.
Other items in the it@@ iner@@ ary on Sat@@ ur@@ day and Sun@@ day include the vin@@ tage car and trac@@ tor meet and exhi@@ bi@@ tions by companies on the top@@ ic of agriculture and forest@@ ry.
Fur@@ ther attrac@@ tions on Sun@@ day are the cor@@ n ma@@ ze, the craft market and she@@ ep sh@@ ear@@ ing.
Speci@@ ally for children, there is a pet@@ ting zo@@ o, "@@ stra@@ w bo@@ un@@ cy cast@@ le@@ ", trac@@ tor driving (@@ under super@@ vision@@ ) and trac@@ tor sur@@ f@@ ing.

An over@@ view of mil@@ k and eg@@ g alternatives
V@@ eg@@ an nutrition promotes ve@@ get@@ able alternatives to eg@@ gs, mil@@ k and da@@ ir@@ y products.
M@@ ash@@ ed to@@ f@@ u with plant cre@@ am, for example, serves as a substitute for quar@@ k che@@ es@@ e.
The Ve@@ get@@ arian Association will provide further examples on World V@@ eg@@ an Day on 1 Novem@@ ber.
On the occasion of World v@@ eg@@ an Day on 1 November, the Ve@@ get@@ arian Association of Germany will propose a host of v@@ eg@@ an altern@@ ativ@@ es:
P@@ ure plant mar@@ gar@@ ine is a good alternative to but@@ ter, while yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t can be replaced by so@@ ya yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t.
So@@ ya, o@@ at, al@@ mon@@ d or rice mil@@ k can be used in place of mil@@ k.
Pl@@ ant whi@@ pping cre@@ am can replace traditional whi@@ pping cre@@ am.
There are also plant alternatives to eg@@ g@@ s.
Hal@@ f a mas@@ h@@ ed, ri@@ pe ban@@ ana, for example, can replace an eg@@ g as a binding ag@@ ent in a c@@ ak@@ e.
50 gra@@ ms of app@@ le sau@@ ce or a tab@@ les@@ po@@ on of ground lin@@ se@@ ed plus three tab@@ les@@ po@@ ons of water are also su@@ it@@ able.
A d@@ ough becomes flu@@ ff@@ y by replacing eg@@ g with a mix@@ ture of one tab@@ les@@ po@@ on of b@@ aking po@@ w@@ der, one tab@@ les@@ po@@ on of cor@@ n@@ flo@@ ur and three tab@@ les@@ po@@ ons of miner@@ al water, for example.
50 gra@@ ms of so@@ ya yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t or sil@@ ken to@@ f@@ u can also ful@@ fi@@ l this purpo@@ se.
According to information from the Ve@@ get@@ arian Associ@@ ation, around 800@@ ,000 Germans currently have a v@@ eg@@ an di@@ et, i.@@ e. a 100% ve@@ get@@ able di@@ et.
S@@ le@@ e@@ pl@@ ess in New York
On the way to their host families in W@@ ey@@ mou@@ th, Massachus@@ ett@@ s, the p@@ up@@ ils of the Schwarz@@ wal@@ d Gra@@ m@@ mar School got to know the American city of New Yor@@ k.
After an eigh@@ t-@@ hour f@@ light, they headed stra@@ ight for B@@ roo@@ kl@@ yn Bri@@ d@@ ge, via which the heart of the city, Man@@ hat@@ t@@ an, can be reached on foo@@ t.
From here there is a fasc@@ in@@ ating view of the world-@@ famous sky@@ line, which is particularly impressive in the ev@@ ening light.
D@@ ue to the time differ@@ ence, the p@@ up@@ ils had been on the go for almost 24 hour@@ s, however, true to the slogan@@ , "the city never sle@@ ep@@ s@@ ", the day was ro@@ unded off with a trip to Times S@@ quar@@ e.
In sp@@ ite of a shut@@ down, they were able to visit the Stat@@ ue of Liber@@ ty on the second day, and clim@@ b the stat@@ ue on foo@@ t.
They then moved on to the Financial Di@@ stric@@ t, via Wall Stre@@ et, to visit the 9/@@ 11 mem@@ ori@@ al.
On the third day, the p@@ up@@ ils were able to take in an over@@ view of the fasc@@ in@@ ating city from the viewing platform of the Empire State Buil@@ ding, enjo@@ ying the views from a hei@@ ght of 3@@ 7@@ 3 met@@ res.
They then made their way through the hu@@ st@@ le and bu@@ st@@ le of the New York stre@@ ets, via the Ro@@ cker@@ f@@ eller Cent@@ er, to Central Park@@ , which provided the perfect opportunity to rest a while in the Aut@@ um@@ n sun@@ .
Following a short flight from New York to Bost@@ on, the p@@ up@@ ils have now arrived with their host families and are experiencing the school day at W@@ ey@@ mou@@ th High Scho@@ ol@@ .
Once again this year, on S@@ ain@@ t Hu@@ ber@@ t@@ 's day, a Hu@@ bert mass will be celeb@@ rated in the Par@@ ish of St. Mari@@ en on H@@ Ã¼l@@ s@@ berg@@ stra@@ s@@ se.
St. Hu@@ bert was, according to legen@@ d, a truly ruth@@ less h@@ unter@@ , who conver@@ ted following a vision and was later appointed Bis@@ ho@@ p of L@@ Ã¼t@@ ti@@ ch.
H@@ unting hor@@ n group "@@ Jag@@ drei@@ ter West@@ fal@@ en@@ ", under the direc@@ tor@@ ship of Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Klu@@ th, played old, traditional French mel@@ o@@ dies on par@@ force hor@@ ns (@@ natural hor@@ ns in the key of E fl@@ at@@ ).
The wind players we@@ ar riding clo@@ th@@ es, as they provide musi@@ cal ac@@ comp@@ anim@@ ent mainly for ri@@ ders, hor@@ ses and pack@@ s of ho@@ unds on drag h@@ un@@ ts.
The sol@@ em@@ n mass is to take place on Sun@@ day 3 November at 1@@ 1.@@ 30 a@@ .@@ m.
The newly designed Op@@ schlag stands out with a new c@@ af@@ Ã©@@ .
One that inv@@ ites you to ling@@ er a while and to come again.
One that wants to get its name out there.
According to dic@@ tion@@ aries, d@@ Ã©@@ j@@ Ã  v@@ u is defined as a psychological phenomen@@ on, which expres@@ ses itself in the feeling of having already experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of a visit to the c@@ af@@ Ã© of the same name at the Op@@ schlag in K@@ le@@ ve Coun@@ ty, with a view of the R@@ h@@ ein@@ -@@ Wa@@ al University, it does@@ n't always have to remain a pure d@@ Ã©@@ j@@ Ã  v@@ u feel@@ ing.
Ultimately, this is precisely the aim of the c@@ af@@ Ã© with the won@@ der@@ ful nam@@ e: to make an actual visit and something that can be repeated on a recur@@ ring basis, not just theore@@ tic@@ ally, but tan@@ gi@@ bl@@ y.
Because it is fu@@ n and simply beauti@@ ful.
A gl@@ ance into the internal work@@ ings at Op@@ schlag 8 gives the on@@ look@@ er a positive feeling right from the outs@@ et.
With its ultra-@@ modern yet co@@ sy c@@ af@@ Ã© ambi@@ ence, it looks like a place designed to make you feel good.
The team here, with business founder@@ s, M@@ ir@@ j@@ am van der St@@ elt and Daniel B@@ Ã¼t@@ tner at the hel@@ m, spo@@ ils gu@@ ests with a wide range of coff@@ ees and co@@ ck@@ tail@@ s.
In addition to this, there are deli@@ cious c@@ ak@@ es or fres@@ h@@ ly bak@@ ed bag@@ u@@ ett@@ es, filled to order.
The owner@@ s, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves as restau@@ rat@@ e@@ urs prior to opening the ch@@ ic c@@ af@@ Ã© on the Op@@ schlag@@ : They previously managed the "@@ Art Lo@@ unge@@ " in K@@ ran@@ en@@ bur@@ g.
By moving to K@@ le@@ ve on the Op@@ schlag@@ , the friendly c@@ af@@ Ã© lo@@ vers hope to reach a wider audi@@ ence.

Daniel B@@ Ã¼t@@ tner is more of an es@@ pres@@ so f@@ an, while M@@ ir@@ j@@ am van der St@@ elt is the cap@@ pu@@ cc@@ ino drin@@ k@@ er.
"@@ And a bag@@ u@@ ette with it - that@@ 's my th@@ ing@@ ," she revealed to the N@@ R@@ Z@@ .
There have already been two events held in the brigh@@ tly lit c@@ af@@ Ã©@@ .
Or perhaps more accur@@ ately, one.
This is because the Haf@@ en@@ fest took place more outside than in - C@@ af@@ Ã© D@@ Ã©@@ j@@ Ã  V@@ u did not benefit from it.
However, there was also the R@@ ing@@ el@@ nat@@ z even@@ ing.
The two 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds found it "@@ beauti@@ ful, successful and fun@@ n@@ y@@ ".
But it was not for everyone.
Perhaps this is why Daniel B@@ Ã¼t@@ tner is not a vo@@ cal f@@ an of ev@@ ening event@@ s: "@@ You just cannot ple@@ ase every@@ one@@ ".
And with an ev@@ ent, I am always only appealing to those who have expressed an interest in the special ev@@ ent.
For this reason, events will always be an exception to the rule for us.
"@@ We want to cause as little disruption as possible to normal business@@ ".
That is to sa@@ y: D@@ Ã©@@ j@@ Ã  V@@ u also stands for reli@@ ability.
This is with regard to the quality of the products that are offered here, as well as the team and the fantas@@ tic setting on the Op@@ schlag in K@@ le@@ ve.

This is to the deli@@ ght of many K@@ le@@ ve resid@@ ents, gu@@ ests from near and far and the students who are discover@@ ing the '@@ restau@@ rant mi@@ le@@ '@@ , and with it the C@@ af@@ Ã© D@@ Ã©@@ j@@ Ã  V@@ u, for themselves.

A day of thanks with the M@@ G@@ V (M@@ ale Ch@@ or@@ al Soci@@ et@@ y) in Din@@ ker
This year the "@@ Fri@@ edri@@ ch Wil@@ hel@@ m Din@@ ker@@ " M@@ G@@ V issued an inv@@ itation to its 16@@ 5@@ th anniversary celeb@@ ration, which 5@@ 2 gu@@ est@@ s, active sing@@ ers and their wi@@ ves were happy to accep@@ t.
In the club@@ house at the "@@ Wit@@ te@@ bor@@ g@@ " In@@ n in Din@@ ker, all those present enjoyed the friendly ge@@ t-@@ together in the name of musi@@ c.
Tradition@@ ally, the anniversary celeb@@ ration is also always the fit@@ ting occasion to best@@ ow hon@@ our@@ s.
This time aro@@ und, secretary Rol@@ f W@@ agen@@ er was de@@ ligh@@ ted to receive the special "@@ Sing@@ er of the Year@@ " awar@@ d.
"@@ Not only have you kept countless records for us, but you have also done so much running around for us, and for this we offer our sin@@ c@@ ere th@@ ank@@ s@@ ," said Cho@@ ir Chairman E@@ rich Sch@@ lo@@ t@@ man@@ n.

UN ha@@ ils new goals to tackle poverty
The United Nations is to start work immediately on a new set of goals to replace the millenni@@ um development goals, which were put place 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for "@@ sustainable development go@@ al@@ s" to replace the MDG@@ s, which exp@@ ire in 2015, ahead of the UN sustainable development summit that began in Rio de Jan@@ ei@@ ro overnigh@@ t.
They were included in the final draft of the docum@@ ent, which will be endorsed by world leaders including M@@ s Gil@@ lar@@ d during the summit@@ .
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit over@@ night that now is the time to "@@ rise above national interest@@ s@@ ."
"@@ I am pleas@@ ed that member states have agreed to launch and take ownership of a process to establish universal sustainable development goals - SDG@@ s@@ ," he sa@@ id.
These SDG@@ s will build on our advances under the millenni@@ um development goals, and they will be an integral part of the post-@@ 2015 development framework.
I will sp@@ are no effort to implement the mandate given to me by member states to reali@@ se our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDG@@ s.
Even though the S@@ G Ach@@ im@@ /@@ B@@ aden has gone four match days without vic@@ tory, a positive mood is still prevailing within the top flight hand@@ ball te@@ am.
Tra@@ in@@ er Tom@@ as@@ z Mal@@ mon will not let there be any doubt of this fac@@ t.
Everyone is still fully motivated for the task at hand.
That said, I do hope that we finally start winning again.
"@@ I no longer remember how a victory like that ta@@ st@@ es@@ ," said Mal@@ mon@@ , anticip@@ ating success for his team at V@@ f@@ L Fre@@ den@@ be@@ ck II.
Even though the third-@@ tier reserves from Fre@@ den@@ be@@ ck are no@@ 't exactly in the best form at the moment, Mal@@ mon has issued a warning in advance
I trained many of the players my@@ self in the A-@@ You@@ th.
Consequ@@ ently, they will be particularly motivated playing against their former co@@ ach@@ .
"@@ In addition, we will have to wait and see whether rein@@ forc@@ ements from the first team will be there@@ ," explained the S@@ G co@@ ach@@ .
In any case, if they are to finally get back on the winning tra@@ ck, Mal@@ mon@@ 's team will have to improve on recent performan@@ c@@ es.
There have been major problems, primarily in terms of covering and counter attack@@ ing.
The team@@ 's eye for the goal must be considerably impro@@ ved.

Moz@@ ambi@@ que security concerns moun@@ t as powerful person@@ alities clash
With a stat@@ ue of Sam@@ or@@ a Mach@@ el, Moz@@ ambi@@ qu@@ e's founding president, star@@ ing down on them, thousands of people gathered in central M@@ ap@@ u@@ to to ch@@ ant peace slogan@@ s in a rare public demonstra@@ tion.
"@@ We want peace back@@ ; we want stabilit@@ y@@ ," said V@@ an@@ ess@@ a de So@@ us@@ a, chief executive of an investment compan@@ y.
F@@ ear@@ ful about the future of her country, she sw@@ apped her corporate at@@ ti@@ re for a T-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t emb@@ la@@ zon@@ ed with "@@ we demand securit@@ y" in Portu@@ gu@@ ese as she joined the crow@@ ds in the capit@@ al@@ 's Independence Square on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clas@@ hes between government forces and Ren@@ am@@ o, some of the worst sk@@ ir@@ mis@@ hes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago.
Ren@@ am@@ o was once a notori@@ ous rebel movement, initially backed by whit@@ e-@@ ruled R@@ ho@@ des@@ ia and then South Africa's apar@@ theid government as part of efforts to destabili@@ se the country's independent government.
After a 1992 peace deal, it became an opposition party.
Analy@@ sts believe the country is unlikely to sli@@ de back into full-@@ blow@@ n conflict, but recent events have un@@ ner@@ ved foreign investors and lo@@ cal@@ s.
The stakes are high for the fast-@@ growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the nor@@ th@@ west could bring in more than $@@ 50@@ b@@ n of investment over the next few next years from companies including Rio T@@ in@@ to, V@@ ale of Brazil, En@@ i of Italy and An@@ ad@@ ark@@ o of the US.
The ruling Fre@@ lim@@ o party, the dominant political force since 197@@ 5, and Ren@@ am@@ o blame each other for the ten@@ sion.
Ren@@ am@@ o says the government initiated the latest clas@@ hes by launching an attack on its members in So@@ fal@@ a provinc@@ e, traditionally a Ren@@ am@@ o stron@@ gh@@ old, on October 17.
Ass@@ aul@@ ts on the former rebels then escal@@ ated as government forces attacked Ren@@ am@@ o bases and attempted to kill Af@@ on@@ so D@@ hl@@ ak@@ am@@ a, the group@@ 's leader, Fern@@ and@@ o Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a, Ren@@ am@@ o@@ 's spo@@ kes@@ man, told the Financial Tim@@ es.
The government blam@@ es Ren@@ am@@ o for triggering the clas@@ h@@ es, acc@@ using it of attacking soldi@@ ers.
President Arm@@ and@@ o Gu@@ eb@@ u@@ za has sought to play down concerns about instability.
M@@ r Gu@@ eb@@ u@@ za told A@@ F@@ P, the French news agen@@ cy, on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day that M@@ r D@@ hl@@ ak@@ ama saw himself as a "@@ loser@@ " who wanted to use "@@ whatever remains of his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decision@@ s@@ ."
Both Fre@@ lim@@ o and Ren@@ am@@ o insist they want to avoid war.
But concerns have grown after M@@ r Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a was quo@@ ted as saying Ren@@ am@@ o was abandoning the 1992 peace acc@@ or@@ d.
He told the F@@ T that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by F@@ reli@@ mo@@ .
"@@ Our vision is to come back to negotiations, but with seri@@ ous@@ ness@@ ," M@@ r Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a sa@@ id.
Pre@@ vious talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fu@@ elled by a series of clas@@ hes this year.
"@@ It@@ 's two big men (@@ Gu@@ eb@@ u@@ za and D@@ hl@@ ak@@ am@@ a) but@@ ting heads toge@@ ther@@ ," said Joseph Han@@ lon@@ , a lec@@ tur@@ er at the Open University and Moz@@ ambi@@ que exper@@ t.
Neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are necessary.
Ren@@ am@@ o, which has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said that it would boyco@@ tt municipal elections due in Novem@@ ber.
Presiden@@ tial and parliamentary polls are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions and financial spo@@ ils from the government.
Ren@@ am@@ o@@ 's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a ne@@ wer party, the Democratic Mo@@ vement of Moz@@ ambi@@ que (M@@ D@@ M@@ ) which was formed by a former Ren@@ am@@ o member@@ , is expected to improve its showing at the elections.
M@@ r Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a says M@@ r Gu@@ eb@@ u@@ za - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"@@ He does not want multi-@@ party democracy, he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presiden@@ cy@@ ," M@@ r Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a sa@@ id.
It is un@@ clear how much capacity Ren@@ am@@ o has, but it has carried out disruptive hit@@ -and-@@ run attacks on police st@@ ations and vehicles on a key nor@@ th-@@ south high@@ way.
Most of the sk@@ ir@@ mis@@ hes have taken place in So@@ fal@@ a provinc@@ e, which is several hundred kil@@ om@@ et@@ res north of M@@ ap@@ ut@@ o, but ho@@ sts Bei@@ ra, the port that min@@ ers, including Rio T@@ into and V@@ ale, rely on to export co@@ al.
In June, Rio suspended its use of the rail@@ way for about a week after Ren@@ am@@ o threatened to attack the line.
M@@ r Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a was co@@ y when asked about whether Ren@@ am@@ o would repeat this threat.
Ren@@ am@@ o wanted to "@@ war@@ n the international community that things were not going well in Moz@@ ambi@@ qu@@ e@@ ," M@@ r Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a sa@@ id.
The instability has added to frustra@@ tions with the government, says Fern@@ and@@ o Li@@ ma, head of Medi@@ ac@@ o@@ op@@ , an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and a recent sp@@ ate of kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings.
"@@ People think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and he should be the one to find solutions for the problem@@ s@@ ," he say@@ s.
O@@ mar S@@ ul@@ tu@@ an@@ e, a demonstrat@@ or, said people just wanted stability.
"@@ No one car@@ es about Ren@@ am@@ o and F@@ reli@@ mo@@ , they just want peace again, they want free access to the road@@ s@@ ," he sa@@ id.
Childr@@ en should be taught my@@ ths and legen@@ ds as "@@ models for a way of life@@ ", author say@@ s.
T@@ ales of Th@@ or could show "@@ bru@@ te strength is no match for sub@@ tle tri@@ cker@@ y@@ ," while the Arth@@ uri@@ an legen@@ ds reveal the importance of having a dre@@ am.
Sa@@ ying many of the my@@ ths would be "@@ far too wil@@ d, far too scand@@ al@@ ous and in some cases far too fil@@ thy to be taught in school@@ s@@ ," Cro@@ ss@@ le@@ y-@@ Holland advocated a "@@ careful selec@@ tion@@ " of age-@@ appropriate works.
"@@ I find it won@@ der@@ ful that in America, myth and fol@@ kl@@ ore already has a part in educ@@ ation@@ ," he sa@@ id.
I have been advocating it as a plan for twent@@ y years.
He added auth@@ ors and teachers being "@@ over@@ tly did@@ ac@@ tic@@ " is a "@@ total swit@@ ch-@@ off@@ " for children, with messages being "@@ sub@@ li@@ min@@ at@@ ed@@ " in enjo@@ y@@ able st@@ ori@@ es.
Cro@@ ss@@ le@@ y-@@ Holl@@ and, who has transl@@ ated Be@@ ow@@ ul@@ f from Anglo@@ -S@@ ax@@ on as well as writing the Pen@@ gu@@ in Bo@@ ok of Nor@@ se My@@ ths and British Fol@@ k Tal@@ es, sa@@ id@@ : "@@ You may well have intentions but you do better to keep them well out of sigh@@ t@@ ."
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for an adult and an adult author writing for a child is the necessi@@ ty for some sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simpli@@ fied or come to a happy end@@ ing, but that there is an inn@@ ate sense of good and ev@@ il.
And that must be sub@@ li@@ min@@ at@@ ed; revealed through a story rather than stat@@ ed.
The old basis of showing not tell@@ ing.
H@@ ans@@ j@@ ak@@ ob back in Frei@@ h@@ of once again
100 years ago, H@@ ein@@ rich H@@ ans@@ j@@ ak@@ ob moved into his retirement home in Has@@ l@@ ach, on Sun@@ day his final years in the "@@ Frei@@ ho@@ f@@ " were brought to life.
The large audience was inspired by the extremely am@@ using role play.
From his arri@@ val, to his being confer@@ red with hon@@ or@@ ary citizenship and his death, A@@ lo@@ is Kra@@ f@@ tz@@ cy@@ k, the s@@ crip@@ t@@ wri@@ ter and actor portra@@ ying H@@ ans@@ j@@ ak@@ ob@@ , has written an entertain@@ ing pla@@ y, which received great acc@@ laim under the direc@@ tor@@ ship of Cor@@ ne@@ li@@ a Vol@@ k.
Mar@@ c@@ us Z@@ ag@@ er@@ man@@ n, serving as nar@@ rat@@ or, guided the audience through the ten different scen@@ es, explained circumstances and provided links explaining le@@ aps from his youth to the time when he was approaching retire@@ ment.
On 22 October 191@@ 3, H@@ ans@@ j@@ ak@@ ob returned home to his childhood par@@ adi@@ se, to his Frei@@ ho@@ f.
It was there that the ro@@ le-@@ play began@@ , with A@@ lo@@ is Kra@@ f@@ c@@ zy@@ k sh@@ ining once again in his famous role as the tow@@ n@@ 's great son@@ .
Tru@@ e to sty@@ le, he tra@@ v@@ elled with a two-@@ hor@@ se car@@ ri@@ age drawn by "@@ Schwar@@ zw@@ Ã¤l@@ der FÃ¼@@ ch@@ sen@@ " (@@ Black For@@ est Ch@@ est@@ n@@ ut Hor@@ s@@ es) owned by E@@ rich Be@@ ch@@ erer from MÃ¼@@ hl@@ en@@ bach@@ .
Not only was he received with great ap@@ pl@@ ause from the audi@@ ence, but was also welcomed by his si@@ ster Philipp@@ ine.
Bil@@ ly Sum@@ -@@ Her@@ mann managed un@@ believ@@ ably well to place her@@ self in the role of the si@@ ster and brought the character to life amaz@@ ingly well, in terms of both her expres@@ sions and gest@@ ures.
Between the individual scen@@ es, the MÃ¼@@ hl@@ en@@ bach@@ er Bau@@ ern@@ kap@@ elle played appropri@@ ately selec@@ ted musi@@ cal piec@@ es, thus round@@ ing off the performance.
The hon@@ our of pres@@ enting the ti@@ tle of hon@@ or@@ ary citizen went to Has@@ l@@ ach@@ 's May@@ or, H@@ ein@@ z Win@@ kl@@ er, who, together with a sec@@ tion of the T@@ own Council, made an appearance representing the May@@ or of H@@ Ã¼t@@ ti@@ ch from back in H@@ ans@@ j@@ ak@@ ob@@ 's day.
The "@@ Drei@@ kÃ¶@@ ni@@ g@@ " sing@@ ers then made their own appear@@ ance, leading H@@ ans@@ j@@ ak@@ ob to exc@@ laim@@ : "@@ O@@ h how beauti@@ ful, this brings childhood memories of my own time in a Drei@@ kÃ¶@@ ni@@ g group back to life@@ ".
With their son@@ g, "@@ O J@@ es@@ ul@@ ein@@ ", they de@@ ligh@@ ted the audience in the Frei@@ ho@@ f, as did the "@@ St@@ or@@ ch@@ ent@@ ag@@ sk@@ inder@@ " with their lo@@ ud cri@@ es of "@@ Her@@ aus, Her@@ aus@@ " .
In his day, H@@ ans@@ j@@ ak@@ ob expressed his criticism of the institutional ch@@ urch, as well as his concerns regarding the exc@@ esses in the rural economy, the consequences of industri@@ alis@@ ation and the effects of the war.
He found his place of rest on his n@@ ative so@@ il, behind his m@@ aus@@ ole@@ um on the Br@@ and near H@@ of@@ st@@ et@@ ten.
The ro@@ le-@@ play ended with the words "@@ A res@@ tless spirit finally found rest and returned home for@@ ever@@ ".
The performance received great ap@@ pl@@ ause and many words of pra@@ ise from the audi@@ ence.
Bas@@ ket@@ ball@@ : Hop@@ es are growing for the N@@ eck@@ ar Ri@@ esen (N@@ eck@@ ar Gi@@ an@@ ts@@ ).
The chances of the rel@@ eg@@ ated L@@ ud@@ wi@@ gs@@ burg Bu@@ des@@ lig@@ a bas@@ ket@@ ball players remaining in the le@@ ague have impro@@ ved.
This is because there is to be a wild card procedu@@ re, and the N@@ eck@@ ar Ri@@ esen are now up against one applic@@ ant fe@@ wer@@ .
The Ham@@ burg To@@ wers bas@@ ket@@ ball project is declining to make an application for a possible stand@@ -@@ in place.
"@@ We will not participate in the wild card process@@ ," said former national team player Pas@@ cal Roll@@ er, who has been putting together the concept for a professional clu@@ b in the H@@ ans@@ a town since 2012.
However, there was no si@@ gh of relief to be heard from L@@ ud@@ wi@@ gs@@ bur@@ g.
"@@ We are not concerning ourselves with the wild card process until it is certain that D@@ Ã¼s@@ sel@@ dor@@ f is not receiving a lic@@ enc@@ e@@ ," said bo@@ ss of the N@@ eck@@ ar Ri@@ esen Alexander Rei@@ l, speaking to our pap@@ er.
New@@ ly promoted D@@ Ã¼s@@ sel@@ dor@@ f Bas@@ k@@ ets have until 23 May to sub@@ mit documents to the arbit@@ ration panel and prove their financial fit@@ ness for the Bundes@@ lig@@ a.
However, the R@@ hin@@ eland team have already been refused the lic@@ ence twi@@ ce.

Following a visit to the Nuclear B@@ unk@@ er Mus@@ e@@ um, the focus will turn to H@@ aig@@ er@@ lo@@ ch in the period after 18@@ 50, when H@@ aig@@ er@@ lo@@ ch came under P@@ rus@@ sian rule.
The crow@@ ning gl@@ ory will be a visit to the Aben@@ d@@ ma@@ hl@@ sk@@ ir@@ che.
There the participants of the t@@ our will be told the story of the construction of the ch@@ urch and will gain insi@@ ght into the development of the Protest@@ ant con@@ greg@@ ation, in what is a Catholic area through and through@@ .

Snow@@ den may make further statements in Russia
The former US intelligence exper@@ t, Edward Snow@@ den, may make further statements regarding the US es@@ pi@@ on@@ age scandal from his Russian asyl@@ um.
Represent@@ atives of the Federal Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ or could either sub@@ mit questions in writing or meet the 30-@@ year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by the Inter@@ fa@@ x Agency with reference to groups aware of the situation, which were not named in greater detail@@ .
Such matters are to be clari@@ fied at an inter@@ governmental level, it was stat@@ ed.
A departure of Snow@@ den from Russia is virtually impossible.
"@@ If this were to happ@@ en, he would lose his status as a refuge@@ e@@ ," said the Agen@@ cy, quo@@ ting their sourc@@ e.
Because Germany is an ally of the USA, Snow@@ den would be at risk of de@@ port@@ ation if he were to travel there, the source continu@@ ed.
En@@ dur@@ ance pays dividen@@ ds
Si@@ x teams batt@@ led to become champion at the clu@@ b ten@@ nis to@@ ur@@ n@@ ament@@ .
In the end, it was the endur@@ ance of the Ma@@ ier@@ /@@ B@@ ron@@ ner team that decided the final mat@@ ch.
The ten@@ nis division of the Sport@@ fre@@ unde Ro@@ hr@@ dor@@ f (@@ Ro@@ hr@@ dor@@ f S@@ ports F@@ ans@@ ) enjoyed perfect weather for the to@@ ur@@ nam@@ ent for local club@@ s and enthusi@@ ast@@ s.
The focus of the to@@ ur@@ nam@@ ent was on the fu@@ n of playing ten@@ nis.
Five mat@@ ches were scheduled for each te@@ am, with every team playing one match against all the others.
The mat@@ ches were doub@@ les mat@@ ches with a long set up to nine poin@@ ts, or a maximum du@@ ration of 45 min@@ ut@@ es.
An@@ ja Sch@@ lich@@ ter managed the to@@ ur@@ nam@@ ent
The organisation of the to@@ ur@@ nam@@ ent was placed in the tru@@ st@@ y hands of An@@ ja Sch@@ lich@@ ter, who was supported by Carmen M@@ Ã¼ll@@ er and In@@ ga K@@ ron@@ em@@ ey@@ er.
After the first three mat@@ ches and a lun@@ ch break with past@@ a, the to@@ ur@@ nam@@ ent moved into the crucial phas@@ e.
The fa@@ v@@ ou@@ rit@@ es, An@@ dr@@ e Ma@@ ier@@ /@@ Mat@@ th@@ i@@ as B@@ ron@@ ner, were tied with Michael Kli@@ p@@ pel and Sad@@ m@@ in O@@ sm@@ ici@@ c (@@ both teams from the S@@ G Ro@@ hr@@ wei@@ ler@@ ), meaning that the last two gam@@ es had to produce a vic@@ tor.
At the a@@ wards cerem@@ on@@ y, Carmen M@@ Ã¼ll@@ er finally had the pleas@@ ure of pres@@ enting the Ch@@ all@@ enge Cup to An@@ dr@@ e Ma@@ ier and Mat@@ th@@ i@@ as B@@ ron@@ ner, who had shown the greatest sta@@ ying power on the final leg@@ .
Second place was taken by the Michael Kli@@ p@@ pel / Sad@@ m@@ in O@@ sm@@ ici@@ c partner@@ ship.
B@@ ron@@ ze went to R@@ ain@@ er and Bern@@ d Ma@@ ier of the A@@ sp@@ hal@@ tri@@ ech@@ er te@@ am.
In the late after@@ no@@ on s@@ un, accompanied by coff@@ ee and c@@ ak@@ e, the to@@ ur@@ nam@@ ent drew to a successful clo@@ se.
On the last week@@ end in August, the V@@ og@@ ts@@ bau@@ ern@@ h@@ of Black For@@ est Open Air Mus@@ eum in Gut@@ ach near Hor@@ n@@ berg will once again be firmly in the hands of children.
Tradition@@ ally, the mus@@ eum wel@@ comes visi@@ tors on a Sat@@ ur@@ day and Sun@@ day, this year on on 24 and 25 August, to a c@@ olo@@ ur@@ ful party for children and families as part of the summer holi@@ day programm@@ e, with numerous participation activities and events.
"@@ On both days, adults and children alike can learn various traditional han@@ di@@ cra@@ fts@@ ," said the press releas@@ e.
Whether producing so@@ ap@@ , turning c@@ andl@@ es, fel@@ ting or making sil@@ k, there is a su@@ itable activity whatever your age.
The children will receive help from regional arti@@ s@@ ans, present from 1@@ 1.@@ 00 a@@ .@@ m. until 5@@ :@@ 00 p@@ .@@ m.
Ac@@ tivi@@ ties will also be taking place in the mus@@ eum work@@ sh@@ op@@ .
The young gu@@ ests will be able to demonstrate their man@@ ual skills building cu@@ ck@@ o@@ o pi@@ p@@ es, water whe@@ els or sp@@ inning top@@ s.
The host of old gam@@ es, such as whe@@ el@@ bar@@ row rac@@ ing or wal@@ king on sti@@ l@@ ts, promises plenty of f@@ un.
Here speed and coordination are the order of the day.
For any min@@ iat@@ ure detec@@ tives, the open air mus@@ eum will be offering a my@@ ster@@ y t@@ our through the mus@@ eum on Sat@@ ur@@ day and Sun@@ day, at mid@@ day and 2.@@ 00 p@@ .@@ m. respectiv@@ ely.
On a t@@ our of the pre@@ mis@@ es, the children will have to work out which stories are true and which have been made up.
In addition, visi@@ tors will have the special opportunity to get to know the open air mus@@ eum on a car@@ ri@@ age jour@@ ney drawn by Black For@@ est Ch@@ est@@ n@@ ut hor@@ ses.
It is not just hor@@ ses that can be found and admi@@ red on the ground@@ s, but many other animals such as she@@ ep@@ , go@@ ats, co@@ ws and chick@@ ens as well.
On the Sun@@ day the children will also be able to enjoy the c@@ low@@ n, O@@ tsch@@ , who will be doing p@@ ranks with the mus@@ eum gu@@ ests from 1@@ 1.@@ 00 a@@ .@@ m.
Meanwhile, a co@@ sy and magi@@ cal alternative will be provided by Her@@ mann B@@ Ã¼t@@ tn@@ er.
The stor@@ y-@@ t@@ eller will be taking the younger gu@@ ests to the won@@ der@@ ful world of fair@@ y@@ tale at 1@@ 1.@@ 00 a@@ .@@ m@@ ., 1@@ :@@ 00 p@@ .@@ m. and 3@@ :@@ 00 p@@ .@@ m.
The traditional children@@ 's d@@ ance group from Gut@@ ach will also be performing at 11@@ :@@ 30 a@@ .@@ m.
Furthermore, on both event days, from 1@@ 1.@@ 00 a@@ .@@ m. until 5.@@ 00 p@@ .@@ m@@ ., numerous arti@@ s@@ ans such as the bro@@ om mak@@ er, the se@@ wer@@ , the sp@@ inn@@ er, the wea@@ ver and the bak@@ er will be letting visi@@ tors look over their shoul@@ ders.
So, visi@@ tors to the open air mus@@ eum can expect a vari@@ ed holi@@ day programme right through to the end of the summer holi@@ days in B@@ ad@@ en-@@ W@@ u@@ er@@ t@@ tem@@ ber@@ g.
In a small town in New Zeal@@ and, Bur@@ t Mun@@ ro is considered a lo@@ v@@ able od@@ d@@ b@@ all, all because he resolved to compete in a race in America with his 19@@ 20 mo@@ tor@@ bi@@ k@@ e.
In sp@@ ite of his heart defec@@ t, Bur@@ t could not be deter@@ red from pursuing his dre@@ am.
With his savings, a few don@@ ations and a mortgage on his old work@@ sh@@ op@@ , he set off to Los Angel@@ es by ship.

Unfortunately, in the event of un@@ fa@@ v@@ oura@@ ble win@@ d, they can be heard from far away - and as a result there have already been a number of complaints from people from the north of the tow@@ n.
The 40-@@ year-old said that he is taking the complaints very seriously and has therefore been in touch with those affec@@ ted.
In close consul@@ tation with the authorities, we are now in a position to make the warning signals qui@@ eter by means of the implementation of technical measures.
In future he will also seek open dialogue with neigh@@ bour@@ s.
For Mat@@ th@@ i@@ as Sch@@ rel@@ l has some further plans at the loc@@ ation.
With the construction of the Low@@ er Sa@@ x@@ ony Bri@@ d@@ ge, R@@ hen@@ us M@@ id@@ gar@@ d is continuing to focus on coal exports for power st@@ ations and is one of the major powers in this sector in Europe.
Thanks to the mo@@ oring basi@@ n to the front of the termin@@ al, s@@ unk@@ en to a depth of 18@@ .@@ 5 met@@ res, it has for some time now been possible to un@@ lo@@ ad Cap@@ esi@@ ze bulk car@@ ri@@ ers here.
"@@ In terms of handl@@ ing, this year we hope to break the 3 million ton@@ ne mark@@ ," said Sch@@ r@@ ell.
Al@@ ong@@ side the local E@@ on power plant, the imported co@@ als also go to power plants in@@ land.
When the GD@@ F-@@ Su@@ ez plant is added to the net@@ work, around 5 million t@@ onn@@ es of coal imports per year will be realisti@@ c.

Ben Green@@ man@@ : The T@@ enth An@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the New York Com@@ ed@@ y Fes@@ tiv@@ al: The New Yorker
One could argue that New York City is the birth@@ place of stand@@ up com@@ ed@@ y in Americ@@ a: nearly a hundred years ago, the v@@ au@@ dev@@ illi@@ an Frank Fa@@ y, who served as the master of cerem@@ oni@@ es at the Pal@@ ace The@@ at@@ re, on Bro@@ ad@@ way, started telling j@@ ok@@ es directly to the crow@@ d, in a convers@@ ational manner.
F@@ ay@@ 's innovation has been extended through the years, most recently by the New York Com@@ ed@@ y Fes@@ tiv@@ al.
Cre@@ ated and over@@ seen by Car@@ ol@@ ine Hir@@ sch, the founder of the stand@@ up institution Car@@ ol@@ ines, the fes@@ tiv@@ al celeb@@ rates its tent@@ h anniversary this year, with more than six@@ ty shows at small club@@ s and large the@@ at@@ res.
"@@ Most of these head@@ lin@@ ers appeared at Car@@ ol@@ ines, and went on to greater success, to the point where the@@ y@@ '@@ re too big to play a club@@ ," Hir@@ sch sa@@ id.
We built this fes@@ tiv@@ al as a way of continuing to work with them.
This year@@ 's event includes appear@@ ances by W@@ anda Sy@@ k@@ es, K@@ ath@@ y Gri@@ ff@@ in, and Bill Mah@@ er, as well as "@@ Stand U@@ p for Her@@ o@@ es@@ ," an annual musi@@ c@@ -and-@@ com@@ ed@@ y benefit for military veter@@ ans, at Ma@@ dis@@ on Square Gar@@ den, feat@@ ur@@ ing, among others, Bru@@ ce Sp@@ ring@@ ste@@ en, J@@ on Ste@@ war@@ t, Ro@@ ger W@@ ater@@ s, and Bill Co@@ s@@ b@@ y.
As the fes@@ tiv@@ al has expan@@ ded, so has the world of com@@ ed@@ y.
Several of the com@@ edi@@ ans participating in this year@@ 's fes@@ tiv@@ al came up through non@@ traditional chann@@ els, such as shows on smaller networks, like Com@@ ed@@ y Cent@@ r@@ al, F@@ X@@ , and Sp@@ ik@@ e.
Nic@@ k K@@ roll rose to promin@@ ence on a deep-@@ c@@ able si@@ t@@ com (F@@ X@@ X@@ 's g@@ le@@ efully ra@@ un@@ ch@@ y fantas@@ y-@@ foot@@ b@@ all-@@ them@@ ed "@@ The Le@@ agu@@ e@@ "@@ ) and now has his own Com@@ ed@@ y Central sk@@ et@@ ch show@@ .
J@@ enn@@ y S@@ late has been a cast member on both "@@ Sat@@ ur@@ day Nig@@ ht Li@@ ve@@ " and "@@ Park@@ s and Rec@@ re@@ ation@@ ," though she is best known for her vi@@ ral video series "@@ Mar@@ c@@ el the Shell with Sho@@ es On@@ ."
Both K@@ roll and S@@ lat@@ e, as well as other young com@@ edi@@ ans with distinc@@ tive voices (the sur@@ really pessimis@@ tic An@@ th@@ ony J@@ es@@ el@@ ni@@ k, the w@@ ry, ra@@ ci@@ ally foc@@ us@@ sed W.

One of the fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ 's biggest draw@@ s will be an inter@@ view@@ : David St@@ ein@@ berg talking to Larry Davi@@ d.
St@@ ein@@ berg started as a stand@@ up com@@ edi@@ an but has become an accomplished television and film direc@@ tor, as well as an un@@ official com@@ ed@@ y histori@@ an.
From 2005 to 2007, he ho@@ sted a show on TV Land called "@@ S@@ it D@@ own Com@@ ed@@ y with David St@@ ein@@ berg@@ ."
The meeting takes place at T@@ own H@@ all, in the center of Man@@ hat@@ t@@ an.
"@@ The city is definit@@ ely in the com@@ ed@@ y DNA of all of Lar@@ r@@ y's work@@ ," St@@ ein@@ berg sa@@ id.

Iran satisfied with the nuclear negotiations process
Iran has expressed satisfaction with the negotiation process, one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany.
"@@ After many years, we have now reached an agreement with the International Nuclear Energy Auth@@ orities to clear up the differences from past year@@ s@@ ," wrote Foreign Minister Mohammed Dsch@@ awa@@ d S@@ ari@@ f on his Facebook pa@@ ge.
It will without doubt be a long pa@@ th, but the chief nuclear negoti@@ ator is satisfied with the negotiation process and is also optimistic that both sides will come to a solution in the end.
Dra@@ ma in Urugu@@ ay@@ : Bo@@ ys kill play@@ m@@ ate with mach@@ etes
Two children have conf@@ essed to the murder of an 1@@ 1-@@ year-old in Urugu@@ a@@ y.
The two boy@@ s, aged 14 and 1@@ 2, had invited their victim to go bir@@ d h@@ unting with them.
On Tu@@ es@@ day, armed with mach@@ etes and k@@ ni@@ ves, they stab@@ bed the 1@@ 1-@@ year-old to death and thre@@ w the body into a well, reported the "@@ El Pa@@ Ã­@@ s" newspaper on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day.
They then went and played football in front of their homes in a working class distric@@ t.
The body was found the following night in the village of C@@ er@@ ro P@@ el@@ ad@@ o, 15 kil@@ om@@ et@@ res to the north of the exclusive be@@ ach resort of P@@ un@@ ta del Est@@ e.
A five year-old half-@@ si@@ ster of the younger offen@@ der, who they took with them, was to make a statement as an ali@@ bi@@ , stat@@ ing that she was sex@@ ually assaul@@ ted by the bo@@ y.
However, when the gir@@ l described the progres@@ sion of events to the police without men@@ tioning an attack against her@@ self@@ , the two boys conf@@ essed to the pre-@@ medi@@ t@@ ated murder of the 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ ol@@ d.
The older of the pa@@ ir cited a rival@@ ry on the football field as the mo@@ tive.
He was provi@@ sion@@ ally taken to a psychiatri@@ c young offen@@ ders institu@@ te.
P@@ im@@ p must go to prison
The Di@@ strict Court of Con@@ stance has condemned a 3@@ 3-@@ year-old man from St. Geor@@ gen to three and a half years in prison for explo@@ it@@ ative human traffick@@ ing, p@@ imp@@ ing, issuing threats and griev@@ ous bodi@@ ly har@@ m.
The former German soldi@@ er who, following two to@@ urs in Afghanistan, had worked as a do@@ or@@ man, made a conf@@ ession within the context of a p@@ lea@@ -@@ bargaining procedu@@ re.
According to the conf@@ ession, on five occa@@ sions he got to know women via Internet or tel@@ eph@@ one contac@@ ts, who he then sent out onto the streets against their will after a few week@@ s.
He broke any resistance by means of violence and the issuing of threat@@ s.
He kept the income from women, some of whom worked for him for years.
He prevented the women from making cont@@ act with the outside world by con@@ fisc@@ ating their mobile phones and SI@@ M car@@ ds.
Toge@@ ther with an ac@@ complic@@ e, who proc@@ ured the women, he brought them to various bro@@ th@@ els in the sou@@ th-@@ wes@@ t.
There he had them monit@@ ored to some extent, in order to control their income.
Ap@@ pe@@ aring before the cour@@ t, the accused initially claimed that he was suffering from severe trau@@ ma after colleagues serving alongside him in Afghanistan had lost their lives in an explo@@ sion.
Once a psychiatri@@ c expert had cast considerable doubt on him suffering from any psychiatri@@ c condi@@ tion, and thus on his limited cul@@ p@@ ability, the 3@@ 3-@@ year-old made a full conf@@ ession.
The court did not have to question any more of the female victim@@ s.
As an official from the Criminal Inv@@ es@@ tig@@ ation Department repor@@ ted, following the first conviction achieved using tel@@ eph@@ one surveillance measures, at least four further cases of explo@@ it@@ ative human traffick@@ ing could be identi@@ fied.
The inter@@ cep@@ ted convers@@ ations were character@@ ised by a high level of aggres@@ sion.
In subsequent hear@@ ings, the victims confirmed their or@@ deal.
A further witn@@ ess, whereby one of the woman had suffered blu@@ e bru@@ is@@ es all over her body, is yet to make a stat@@ ement.
This is a case of a "@@ completely broken person@@ alit@@ y@@ ", that views the violence and explo@@ itation in this field as norm@@ al.
Y@@ ester@@ day the accused expressed regre@@ t for his behavi@@ our@@ .
"@@ I have removed my@@ self from these circ@@ les and hope to lead a completely normal life following my imprison@@ ment@@ ," he stat@@ ed.
Oil extends drop toward $@@ 9@@ 6 a barrel
The price of oil continued to fall on Fri@@ day as concerns over high supplies offset a report showing China's power@@ -@@ hungry manufacturing sector is strength@@ en@@ ing.
Ben@@ ch@@ mark U@@ .@@ S. crude for December delivery was down 14 cents at $@@ 9@@ 6.@@ 24 a barrel by late mor@@ ning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York M@@ erc@@ anti@@ le Ex@@ change.
The contract fell 39 cents on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day, leaving it down 5.@@ 8 perc@@ ent for the month of Octo@@ ber.
Am@@ ple supplies of crude have weigh@@ ed on the price in recent week@@ s.
The Energy Department said W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day that U@@ .@@ S. supplies increased 4.@@ 1 million barrel@@ s last week@@ .
Over five weeks, supplies have risen by more than 25 million barrel@@ s.
But a sugges@@ tion of stronger demand came Fri@@ day from two reports on Chinese manufacturing that showed an up@@ tic@@ k in activity.
That suggests China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth re@@ bo@@ unded to 7.@@ 8 perc@@ ent in the third quarter from a two-@@ decade low in the previous quar@@ ter.
Br@@ ent cru@@ de, a benchmark for international crude also used by U@@ .@@ S. re@@ fin@@ eri@@ es, fell 26 cents to $@@ 10@@ 8.@@ 5@@ 8 a barrel on the IC@@ E exchange in London.
Court blocks ruling on N@@ Y@@ P@@ D stop@@ -and-@@ fri@@ sk policy
A federal appeals court on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day blocked a jud@@ ge@@ 's order requiring changes to the New York Poli@@ ce Depart@@ ment@@ 's stop@@ -and-@@ fri@@ sk program and removed the judge from the case.
The 2@@ nd U@@ .@@ S. C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it Court of Ap@@ pe@@ als said the decisions of Jud@@ ge Sh@@ ir@@ a Sch@@ ein@@ d@@ lin will be st@@ ayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the c@@ ity.
The judge had ruled in August the city viol@@ ated the Constitution in the way it carried out its program of stopp@@ ing and ques@@ tioning people.
The city appe@@ aled her findings and her re@@ medi@@ al order@@ s, including a decision to as@@ sign a monitor to help the police depart@@ ment changes its policy and training program associated with it.
The appeals court heard arguments Tu@@ es@@ day on the requ@@ est@@ ed sta@@ y.
The appeals court said the judge needed to be removed from the case because she ran af@@ oul of the code of conduct for U@@ .@@ S. judges by com@@ promising the necessi@@ ty for a judge to avoid the appearance of parti@@ ality in part because of a series of media inter@@ views and public statements responding publicly to criticism of the cour@@ t.
The judge had ruled that police officers viol@@ ated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrong@@ ly targeting black and His@@ panic men with its stop@@ -and-@@ fri@@ sk program.
She appointed an outside monitor to over@@ see major changes, including reforms in policies, training and super@@ vision, and she ordered a pilo@@ t program to test bod@@ y-@@ wor@@ n cam@@ er@@ as in some prec@@ inc@@ ts where most st@@ ops occur@@ .
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of stor@@ ing the names and addres@@ ses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police stop@@ .
An or@@ al argument on the cit@@ y's appeal is scheduled for some@@ time after March 1@@ 4, 2014.
The stop@@ -and-@@ fri@@ sk tac@@ tic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advoc@@ ates.
St@@ op@@ -and-@@ fri@@ sk has been around for decades in some form, but recorded st@@ ops increased dramatically under the administration of independent May@@ or Michael B@@ loom@@ berg to an all-@@ time high in 2011 of 6@@ 8@@ 4,@@ 3@@ 3@@ 0, mostly of black and His@@ panic men.
A law@@ suit was fil@@ ed in 2004 by four men, all minori@@ ties, and became a class action case.
Sup@@ por@@ ters of changes to the N@@ Y@@ PD@@ 's stop@@ -and-@@ fri@@ sk program say the changes will end unfair practic@@ es, will m@@ old a more trusted and effective police force and can affect how other police depart@@ ments use the policy.
O@@ pp@@ on@@ ents say the changes would lower police mor@@ ale but not crime, waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking by thousands of officers during the last decade.
The judge noted she was@@ n't putting an end to the stop@@ -and-@@ fri@@ sk practice, which is constitu@@ tion@@ al, but was reforming the way the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D implemented its stop@@ s.
On the happiness of dream@@ ing cam@@ els
H@@ app@@ iness is an o@@ asi@@ s that only dream@@ ing cam@@ els manage to reach
It was with this piece of Bed@@ ou@@ in wisdom that the first ever chairman Wolfgang H@@ enn@@ e described the history and fasc@@ ination behind the "@@ Hel@@ ping Hand@@ s" society.
Sat@@ ur@@ day ev@@ ening saw the celeb@@ ration of the tent@@ h birth@@ day of the organis@@ ation, which can already look back on impressive results.
Found@@ ing Chairman H@@ enn@@ e reported in depth on the work of the organis@@ ation.
In 2004, he visited the C@@ hei@@ j@@ k-@@ Z@@ aj@@ ed Ho@@ sp@@ ital in N@@ ou@@ ak@@ cho@@ tt in Mau@@ rit@@ ania for the first time.
As a result, an important collaboration was developed and the g@@ yn@@ a@@ ec@@ ologi@@ st, Han@@ ne, has performed countless operations on several jour@@ ne@@ ys to the loc@@ ation.
During the speech, images from the tri@@ ps were shown on a large scre@@ en, in order to give the gu@@ ests at the anniversary event an insi@@ ght into the initiatives men@@ tion@@ ed.
The organis@@ ation@@ 's des@@ ert vehicle was also show@@ n.
It is a former federal border protection vehic@@ le.
R@@ ain@@ er Pre@@ wo@@ , the former Lord May@@ or of Nag@@ old, made the sugges@@ tion of equi@@ pping this vehicle with a photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic system and, according to Hen@@ ne, he is now planning to assume an advis@@ ory role within the organis@@ ation.
In 2008, the Schle@@ eh car@@ p@@ entry company from Ba@@ ier@@ s@@ b@@ ron@@ n built the hospital station in So@@ co@@ gi@@ m, a poor distric@@ t on the edge of the Capit@@ al, in the record time of less than one week - free of char@@ ge.
H@@ enn@@ e also mentioned a new mother and child hospital in N@@ ou@@ ak@@ cho@@ tt
This is particularly interesting at a time when Nag@@ old is set to do away with its mat@@ ern@@ ity clin@@ ic.
You learn a great deal working as a doc@@ tor in Africa, said Hen@@ ne, for example that you should slow down to avoid bur@@ n-@@ out.
D@@ ue to the political unrest in the country, it has not been possible to make as many jour@@ ne@@ ys as plan@@ ned, but for this reason, many local doctors have come to Germany, to sit in on lec@@ tures on a variety of top@@ ics.
In addition, contain@@ ers with materials are regularly sent to Africa, for example in March of this year when medical devic@@ es, medic@@ ines, band@@ aging materi@@ al, hospital be@@ ds and spectac@@ les were s@@ ent.
Co@@ -@@ initi@@ ator H@@ ans@@ -@@ Jo@@ ach@@ im Fu@@ ch@@ tel himself provided plenty of local c@@ olo@@ ur, telling of M@@ erc@@ edes vehicles in Mau@@ rit@@ ania conver@@ ted into mobile go@@ at st@@ alls and sharing the experiences of the Stamm@@ hei@@ m musi@@ ci@@ ans, who traditionally support the organisation on their tri@@ ps to Mau@@ rit@@ ani@@ a.
He identified his personal motivation as being his work in the area of audi@@ ting as a young member of parliament@@ .
When it became clear to him how much money is wast@@ ed, he decided to help the Africans with controlling of their budget by the people.
Fu@@ ch@@ tel also emphasi@@ sed that a global economy requires global human kin@@ d@@ ness.
The fact that Africa lies closer than many think should by no means be for@@ go@@ t@@ ten.
Africa is not at all that far from Gra@@ n Can@@ ari@@ a.
Co@@ ul@@ son used phone hack@@ ing to veri@@ fy tip
Former News of the World edi@@ tor An@@ dy Co@@ ul@@ son allegedly used "@@ phone hack@@ ing, surveillance and confront@@ ation@@ " in an attempt to confirm a bo@@ g@@ us tip about an aff@@ air involving then-@@ home secretary Charles Cl@@ ark@@ e.
Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ or Andrew E@@ dis Q@@ C told the Old B@@ ai@@ ley that the News of the World heard a false rum@@ our in May 2005 that Cl@@ ark@@ e was seeing his "@@ attractive special advis@@ er@@ ," H@@ ann@@ ah P@@ aw@@ l@@ b@@ y.
The newspaper t@@ asked private investig@@ ator G@@ len@@ n Mul@@ ca@@ ire with hack@@ ing P@@ aw@@ l@@ b@@ y's voic@@ em@@ ails and "@@ do@@ or-@@ step@@ ped@@ " her, but Co@@ ul@@ son also called and left her voic@@ em@@ ail@@ s, the court hear@@ d.
"@@ The prosecu@@ tion suggests that M@@ r Co@@ ul@@ son, who is now the edi@@ tor of the Not@@ W@@ , he is not the man who stands outside people@@ 's houses hoping to catch them out, he is the man who likes to put the story to people to see what they will say@@ ," M@@ r E@@ dis sa@@ id.
He said the Not@@ W used three ways to investig@@ ate st@@ ori@@ es: phone hack@@ ing, surveill@@ ance, and confront@@ ation.
The edi@@ tor is personally involved in the thir@@ d.
Ob@@ viously he knows about the second, surveill@@ ance, he must do.
What about the fir@@ st@@ ?
Does he know about phone hack@@ ing?
He says he does@@ n@@ '@@ t, we say "@@ O@@ h yes, he did@@ ".
Ru@@ mo@@ urs about an aff@@ air involving Cl@@ ark@@ e were first picked up by the Not@@ W@@ 's features des@@ k when a source who was sex@@ ually interested in M@@ s P@@ aw@@ l@@ by was tol@@ d: "@@ Don@@ 't bo@@ ther wa@@ sting your time, she@@ 's with Char@@ les@@ ."
A tap@@ e of voic@@ em@@ ails taken from her phone on at least three occa@@ sions was seized from Mul@@ c@@ ai@@ re@@ 's home in August 2006.
Inv@@ es@@ tig@@ ators also found ent@@ ries on the private investig@@ ator@@ 's computer which had M@@ s P@@ aw@@ l@@ by and her si@@ ster as "@@ Projec@@ ts@@ ."
During the period she was being investig@@ ated, M@@ s P@@ aw@@ l@@ b@@ y's grand@@ parents received anony@@ mous calls asking for information about her, M@@ r E@@ dis sa@@ id.
Meanwhile, former chief repor@@ ter N@@ eville Th@@ ur@@ l@@ be@@ ck and former repor@@ ter James We@@ a@@ ther@@ up over@@ saw surveillance of M@@ s P@@ aw@@ l@@ b@@ y's movem@@ ents.
Lea@@ ving her a voic@@ em@@ ail on June 18 2005, Co@@ ul@@ son told her@@ : "@@ I@@ '@@ ve got a story that we@@ '@@ re planning to run tomor@@ row that I really would like to speak to Charles ab@@ out@@ ."
M@@ r E@@ dis said Co@@ ul@@ son@@ 's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former home secretary David Bl@@ unk@@ et@@ t.
The j@@ ury heard on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day that Co@@ ul@@ son confronted M@@ r Bl@@ unk@@ ett over an aff@@ air with a married woman while he was himself seeing co-@@ def@@ end@@ ant Re@@ bek@@ ah Bro@@ ok@@ s, who was married at the time.
Co@@ ul@@ son and Bro@@ ok@@ s deny con@@ sp@@ iring with others to h@@ ack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006.
Mul@@ c@@ ai@@ re, Th@@ ur@@ l@@ be@@ ck and We@@ a@@ ther@@ up have admitted phone hack@@ ing.
In protest against the planned tax on the rich, the French Fo@@ ot@@ ball Association is set to actually go through with the first strike since 197@@ 2.
A medi@@ ation meeting comes to an end without resolu@@ tion.
In the conflict regarding the tax on the wealth@@ y, the government and the professional football association in France have man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ red into a cul@@ -@@ de-@@ sa@@ c following a failed medi@@ ation meet@@ ing.
President FranÃ§ois Hollande welcomed clu@@ b and association representatives to Par@@ is@@ ' Ã@@ ly@@ s@@ Ã©@@ e Pal@@ ace on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day, where he list@@ ened to their complain@@ ts.
However, he refused to sp@@ are the football association from the planned 75% income tax to be imposed on those earning in excess of one million â¬@@ per year, which every company in the country will have to pay for two years, from 2014.
The opposition also remained ad@@ am@@ ant.
The strike announced for the end of November will now go ahead, informed the head of the Union of Prof@@ ession@@ al Fo@@ ot@@ ball Cl@@ ub@@ s (@@ U@@ CP@@ F@@ ), Jean-@@ P@@ ier@@ re Lou@@ vel@@ .

G@@ ech@@ in@@ gen: Ab@@ solu@@ te protection not possible
"@@ We want to involve the residents in the planning at as early a stage as possi@@ ble@@ ," said May@@ or J@@ ens H@@ Ã¤uÃ@@ ler, opening the citizen@@ 's information event regarding the flood protection concept in G@@ ech@@ ing@@ en.
Around 80 participants came to the Gemein@@ de@@ hal@@ le (@@ community hall@@ ) to have the planned measures explained to them, to express their concerns and sub@@ mit ideas.
H@@ Ã¤uÃ@@ ler made clear: "@@ The final decisions will be made by the members of the T@@ own Counc@@ il@@ ".
H@@ Ã¤uÃ@@ ler comment@@ ed that the flood that found G@@ ech@@ ingen un@@ prepared on 15 May 2009, was a decisive event in raising the question of protec@@ tive measures for the future.
A ri@@ ver basi@@ n study was commission@@ ed in collaboration with the neigh@@ bo@@ uring community of A@@ id@@ ling@@ en, which now forms the basis for the flood protection concept in G@@ ech@@ ing@@ en.
"@@ The goal is the protection of as many developed plo@@ ts of land as possi@@ ble@@ ," said H@@ Ã¤uÃ@@ l@@ er.
The basis for the plans is the need for protection against expected flo@@ ods, which statisti@@ cally occurs every 100 years, according to the German We@@ a@@ ther Ser@@ vic@@ e.
Climate change is taken into account in the form of an allow@@ ance of 15 per cent@@ .
In expert circ@@ les this is referred to as "@@ H@@ Q 100@@ a@@ Klima@@ ".
The mass@@ es of water that caused considerable damage in G@@ ech@@ ingen in 2009 was equivalent to a 1,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ year flo@@ od.
"@@ There is no such thing as absolute protection, but we can attempt to make a relative improvem@@ ent@@ ," said H@@ Ã¤uÃ@@ l@@ er.
In order to achieve H@@ Q 100@@ a@@ Klima protection, around four million â¬@@ must be invested in G@@ ech@@ ing@@ en, whereby the town can count on a State subsidy of around 70 per cent@@ .
However, H@@ Ã¤uÃ@@ ler indicated that the funding would only be provided if an overall concept is develop@@ ed.
In order to develop such a concep@@ t, the town is reli@@ ant on the cooperation of its citizens.
A complex planning and approval proced@@ ure must be comple@@ ted.
In a best case scenario, implementation could begin in 201@@ 6.
Among other measures, the protection concep@@ t, which (@@ we repor@@ ted@@ ) has already been presented to the T@@ own Council during the past week, plans local measures in the tri@@ but@@ ary to the Ri@@ ver Ir@@ m, running from the Stamm@@ hei@@ m Valle@@ y.
In con@@ j@@ unc@@ tion with the pres@@ entation of the flood protection concep@@ t, the participants made use of the opportunity to sub@@ mit their concerns.
Among others, the question was raised as to why em@@ bank@@ ments and deten@@ tion reser@@ vo@@ irs are no longer planned to protect the loc@@ ation.
Gre@@ g@@ or KÃ¼@@ hn@@ , technical plann@@ er at the commission@@ ed engineering company, HÃ¼@@ gel@@ sh@@ eim@@ -based '@@ W@@ ald und Cor@@ be@@ '@@ , who presented the concep@@ t, emphasi@@ sed that it required the inter@@ play of all proposed measures, in order that their sum might achieve the desi@@ red goal.
Furthermore, the most economic solution must be found@@ , said Jo@@ ach@@ im W@@ ald of W@@ ald und Cor@@ be.
There was resentment among local residents of the old tow@@ n, who have repeatedly to suffer as a result of the over@@ flowing of the can@@ al net@@ work, even during normal th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms.
The problem is known to the administrative depart@@ ment and initial measures have already been taken.
However, H@@ Ã¤uÃ@@ ler indicated that the guid@@ elines for can@@ al systems are different to those for flood protection, and these must not be conf@@ used.
The town is obliged to design the can@@ al network in such a way that it can withstand ra@@ inf@@ all events every two to three years.
To make the se@@ wer@@ age channels wider would go@@ b@@ ble up milli@@ ons.
Person@@ s seriously in@@ ju@@ red following col@@ li@@ sion
E@@ arly on Fri@@ day after@@ no@@ on, two car drivers were seriously in@@ ju@@ red in a head@@ -@@ on col@@ li@@ sion on Landes@@ stra@@ Ãe 44 (a rural road@@ ).
The police completely blocked off the road immedi@@ ately, but initially could not make much com@@ ment on the cause of the accid@@ ent.
However, they did mention that there were various witness statements that first had to be assess@@ ed.

Is@@ su@@ ing statements regarding the Merkel sp@@ ying scandal from Russia
The former US intelligence exper@@ t, Edward Snow@@ den, may make further statements regarding the US es@@ pi@@ on@@ age scandal involving Federal Chancell@@ or, Angela Merkel, from his Russian asyl@@ um.
Represent@@ atives of the German Federal Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ or@@ 's Office could either sub@@ mit questions in writing or meet the 30-@@ year-old in person in Russia, reported the Inter@@ fa@@ x Agen@@ cy.
Green Party parliament represent@@ ative, H@@ ans@@ -@@ Christian St@@ rÃ¶@@ bel@@ e, was y@@ ester@@ day the first German politician to meet with Snow@@ den in Mosco@@ w, to discuss the scandal with him.
N@@ SA revel@@ ations boost corporate parano@@ ia about state surveillance
On a mil@@ d day in late August a German police heli@@ cop@@ ter bu@@ z@@ zed low over the US consul@@ ate in Frankfur@@ t, the financial capital of Germany.
On the instruc@@ tion of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (B@@ f@@ V@@ ), Germany's domestic intelligence agen@@ cy, its mission was to photo@@ gra@@ ph the ro@@ of@@ top of the US out@@ po@@ st, which is located less than 5@@ k@@ m from the European Central Bank and Bundes@@ bank.
German media say the B@@ f@@ V hoped to identify the presence of list@@ ening anten@@ n@@ as and the action prompted an exchange between the US and the German foreign minist@@ ry in Berlin@@ .
James C@@ lap@@ per@@ , US Director of National Intelligen@@ ce, insisted again in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities "@@ to ste@@ al the trade secre@@ ts of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom lin@@ e@@ ."
But ever since Edward Snow@@ den, the contrac@@ tor turned wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ , began releas@@ ing his treas@@ ure tro@@ ve of US surveillance secre@@ ts, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at his wor@@ d.
Repor@@ ts that the US National Security Agency spi@@ ed on Brazilian oil company Petro@@ bra@@ s and gained access to data held by US clo@@ ud provi@@ ders including Google and Y@@ ah@@ o@@ o have rat@@ ch@@ eted corporate parano@@ ia about state surveillance to new high@@ s.
The final stra@@ w came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merk@@ el@@ 's phone had been bu@@ g@@ ged, possibly for about a decade.
If Europe's most powerful person can be targe@@ ted, then surely business leaders are also potential targets.
Snow@@ den has made transparent the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies.
I think it@@ 's conceiv@@ able that these data are used for mutual benef@@ it.
"@@ Germany must wake up@@ ," says Oli@@ ver GrÃ¼n@@ , president of BI@@ T@@ M@@ i, which represents small and medium si@@ zed German IT companies.
German companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and data th@@ ef@@ t, according to a survey published in July by E@@ Y@@ , the consult@@ anc@@ y.
In all the docum@@ entation le@@ aked by M@@ r Snow@@ den, there has, however, been no evidence to date that the US has passed on foreign compani@@ es' trade secre@@ ts to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities and should stri@@ ve to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are sc@@ ep@@ tical about this.
Some@@ one in the German parliament says we should build a German Goog@@ le.
I can only shut my eyes and slowly open them again@@ ...
"@@ That@@ 's not the way@@ ," Has@@ so Plat@@ tn@@ er, chairman of German business software company SA@@ P, say@@ s.
If one wanted a strong European IT industry, then one sho@@ uld@@ n't have let it die out 20 years ago.
Every@@ thing is subsi@@ dis@@ ed in Germany, from coal, to cars and farmer@@ s.
Every@@ thing but the IT industry.
Still, the reach and technical sophistic@@ ation of US sp@@ y agencies exposed by the Snow@@ den revel@@ ations have come as a shock to some companies who previously thought the biggest surveillance risk was posed by China.
A big shift is occurring in clo@@ ud comp@@ uting where European executives have become more aware that data stor@@ ed in the US is subject to that jurisdic@@ tion and therefore potentially vulner@@ able.
According to a survey carried out by the C@@ lo@@ ud Security Alli@@ ance, a trade body, some 10 per cent of non-@@ US members canc@@ elled plans to use a US-@@ based clo@@ ud provi@@ der after revel@@ ations about the US P@@ rism data mining programm@@ e.
J@@ im S@@ na@@ be, co-@@ chief executive at SA@@ P, say@@ s: "@@ We see a new question from customers that did@@ n't come up a year ago - which is where is my data stor@@ ed and can you guarantee that it sta@@ ys physi@@ cally in that jurisdic@@ tion@@ ."
Many German executives argue that the latest reports are simply confirm@@ ation of what they already k@@ new@@ : that powerful states want to ste@@ al their most pri@@ zed secre@@ ts and these data must therefore be guar@@ ded at all costs.
That economic sp@@ ying takes place is not a surpri@@ se.
It has always taken place.
"@@ This has been a top@@ ic for many years and has@@ n't fundamentally changed through the current discus@@ sion@@ ," says Kur@@ t Bo@@ ck, chief executive of chemical mak@@ er B@@ AS@@ F.
The Americans sp@@ y on us on the commercial and industrial level as we sp@@ y on them too, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Corporate leaders are not generally keen to bo@@ ast about the counter@@ measures they have tak@@ en, in case this hands an advantage to an attack@@ er.
For large companies, the message has long since been dru@@ mm@@ ed home that pi@@ cking up a free US@@ B stick at a trade fair, or leaving a lap@@ top ung@@ u@@ ar@@ ded in a ho@@ tel room are un@@ wise, to say the lea@@ st.
Ul@@ rich Hack@@ en@@ ber@@ g, board member at car@@ mak@@ er Au@@ di, says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collec@@ ted before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote list@@ ening devic@@ es.
Germany's B@@ f@@ V advis@@ es executives to consider using simple pre@@ paid mobil@@ es when on foreign tri@@ ps because of the risk that smart phones are compromis@@ ed.
The pre@@ paid mobil@@ es are then thrown away after@@ war@@ ds.
However, there is concern that small and medium-@@ si@@ zed companies remain vulnerable to hack@@ ing and surveill@@ ance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular nich@@ e.
"@@ Small and medium si@@ zed companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secre@@ ts effectively against un@@ auth@@ or@@ ised acc@@ ess@@ ," the B@@ f@@ V war@@ ns in a repor@@ t.
The US war@@ ns its own companies about economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age by other countries.
The US National Intelligence E@@ stim@@ ate in February named France alongside Russia and Israel in a second tier of offen@@ ders who engage in hack@@ ing for economic intelligen@@ ce, behind China, according to The Washington Po@@ st.
A board member at a German blu@@ e-@@ ch@@ ip company con@@ cur@@ red that when it comes to economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age, "the French are the wor@@ st@@ ."
Bern@@ ard S@@ quar@@ c@@ ini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency D@@ C@@ RI@@ , was quo@@ ted in an inter@@ view this month as say@@ ing: "@@ The services know perfectly well that all countries, even as they co-@@ operate in the anti@@ terrorist figh@@ t, sp@@ y on their alli@@ es@@ ."

"@@ They sent their son to school with a book@@ -@@ b@@ ag and he was returned to them in a body bag@@ ," he sa@@ id.

On W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day, the Cent@@ ers for Dis@@ ease Con@@ tro@@ l and Pre@@ vention released a set of guid@@ elines to manage children@@ 's food all@@ ergi@@ es at school@@ .
This is the first set of such guid@@ elines the U@@ .@@ S. government has put out, as the number of school@@ -@@ age children suffering from food all@@ ergi@@ es clim@@ b@@ s.
One in 20 children in the United States now have food all@@ ergi@@ es.
The C@@ DC found the pre@@ valence of food all@@ ergi@@ es among children increased 18 perc@@ ent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to make fac@@ ul@@ ty and staff aware of children@@ 's food all@@ ergi@@ es, and how to handle them should an all@@ ergi@@ c reaction occur@@ .

Par@@ ents of Inter@@ sex Ki@@ ds Can P@@ ick '@@ Gen@@ der Un@@ determin@@ ed@@ '
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for bab@@ ies born with ambigu@@ ous gen@@ it@@ ali@@ a.
No longer will new@@ bor@@ ns be rigi@@ dly as@@ signed to male or fem@@ al@@ e.
The new law does@@ n't require parents to declare any gender for such children, allowing parents to declare gender "@@ un@@ determin@@ ed@@ " or "@@ un@@ speci@@ fi@@ ed@@ " on their birth cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates.
The aim of the law was to take the pressure off parents who might make ha@@ st@@ y decisions on sex@@ -@@ as@@ sign@@ ment surger@@ y for new@@ bor@@ ns, and to fight discrimination against those who are inter@@ sex@@ .
One inter@@ sex person@@ , according to the BB@@ C, said years later, "@@ I am neither a man nor a wom@@ an@@ ."
I will remain the pat@@ ch@@ work created by doc@@ tors, bru@@ ised and scar@@ red.
An estimated one in 2,000 children born each year is neither bo@@ y nor gir@@ l.
They are inter@@ sex@@ , part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of dis@@ orders of sexual development, an um@@ br@@ ell@@ a term for those with at@@ yp@@ ical ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es, g@@ on@@ ads (@@ o@@ vari@@ es or test@@ es), or un@@ usually developed gen@@ it@@ ali@@ a.
W@@ alli@@ s S@@ imp@@ son may have been inter@@ sex@@ .
Gen@@ der identi@@ fication is still not well understo@@ od, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determin@@ ed, it@@ 's better to use the best available information to as@@ sign it then to wait and monitor the child@@ 's psychological and physical development before under@@ taking surger@@ y, if at all.
New York City psychiatri@@ st Dr. J@@ ack D@@ res@@ ch@@ er, who speci@@ aliz@@ es in issues of gender identi@@ fication, said the new German law "@@ sounds like a good th@@ ing@@ ."
Inter@@ sex children pose ethical dilem@@ ma.
"@@ Some people have life-@@ endang@@ ering conditions that require surger@@ y, but most ki@@ ds do not@@ ," he sa@@ id.
You can make a gender as@@ sign@@ ment without surger@@ y, and then see how identity develop@@ s.
The science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accur@@ ate.
No@@ body can answer the questions about why this happen@@ s.
It@@ 's like the my@@ ster@@ y of why people are ga@@ y.
A report fil@@ ed to the European Commission in 2011 described inter@@ sex people as different from trans@@ sexual or trans@@ gender people, as their status is not gender related but instead rel@@ ates to their biological mak@@ eu@@ p, which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively fem@@ ale, but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either.
These features can mani@@ fest themselves in secondary sexual character@@ istic@@ s, such as mus@@ cle mas@@ s, ha@@ ir distribu@@ tion, bre@@ ast@@ s and stat@@ ure@@ ; primary sexual characteristics such as re@@ productive organ@@ s and gen@@ it@@ ali@@ a; or in ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ al structures and hor@@ mon@@ es.
The report also gives an over@@ view of the discrimination faced by inter@@ sex and trans@@ gender people in the real@@ m of employment, as well as levels of harass@@ ment, violence and bias crimes.

In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversi@@ al, according to a news report on France 2@@ 4.
In 2011, dozens of French law@@ makers from that strongly Catholic country signed a petition for "@@ gender theor@@ y" to be withdraw@@ n from school text@@ book@@ s.
The U@@ .@@ S. we@@ b@@ site Catholic On@@ line has also opposed the German law, writing that "@@ as the world is being dra@@ gged into a new state, where gender is a choice, but sexual activity is not, we reverse two more pillars of civiliz@@ ation@@ ."
One Mar@@ y@@ land mother of a new@@ born also told the Bab@@ y Zone that she would rather see bab@@ ies as@@ signed gender at bir@@ th.
"@@ Par@@ enting is stres@@ s@@ ful enough without extra limit@@ ations, especially if you don't know the gender of your child@@ ," she told the par@@ enting we@@ b@@ si@@ te.
Childr@@ en need stability and certain@@ ty.
Histor@@ ically, children born with both male and female gen@@ it@@ ali@@ a were called her@@ ma@@ ph@@ ro@@ di@@ tes, named for the hand@@ some Greek go@@ d who had dual sexu@@ ality.
And as little as a decade ago, the medical community thought of gender as a s@@ late that could be er@@ as@@ ed and then re@@ draw@@ n.
But now, many are challenging the ethical basis of surger@@ y, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors can sometimes get it wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about their gender as@@ sign@@ ment when they grow up.
"@@ Back in the middle of the 20@@ th century, it was called a '@@ psychiatri@@ c emergen@@ cy@@ ,@@ '@@ " said D@@ res@@ ch@@ er.
When these ki@@ ds were bor@@ n, you did@@ n't call the psychiatri@@ st, you called a sur@@ ge@@ on.
The prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambigu@@ ous gen@@ it@@ ali@@ a was put forward by Dr. John Mon@@ ey at John@@ s Hop@@ k@@ ins University, who held that gender was m@@ alle@@ able.
He co@@ ined the term "@@ gender identi@@ ty@@ " and argued that social and environmental cu@@ es -- how parents raised a child -- inter@@ acted with a child@@ 's genes and hor@@ mon@@ es to shape whether the person identified as male or fem@@ al@@ e.
But in one 196@@ 6 case, known as "@@ John@@ /@@ Jo@@ an@@ ," his theories became controversi@@ al.
He advised the parents of a bo@@ y whose pen@@ is had been sever@@ ed in a bo@@ t@@ ched circum@@ ci@@ sion to have the child fully cast@@ rat@@ ed, removing his tes@@ tic@@ les, as well, and to raise him as a gir@@ l.
"@@ Mon@@ ey presented the case as a successful case of transi@@ tion, but it was not@@ ," said D@@ res@@ ch@@ er.
When the bo@@ y was around 1@@ 5, he transi@@ tioned back to a bo@@ y and married a wom@@ an.
But at 3@@ 8, he committed suici@@ de.
D@@ res@@ cher said that now some doctors are still "@@ practic@@ ing that model@@ ."
But in the 1990s, with the adv@@ ent of the Internet, survivor@@ s of these gender sur@@ geri@@ es have come forward "@@ not happy with the outcom@@ e@@ ."
Such was the case with J@@ im Bru@@ ce, a 3@@ 6-@@ year-old wri@@ ter from Mon@@ tan@@ a, who was born with X@@ Y male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es but ambigu@@ ous gen@@ it@@ als.
D@@ oc@@ tors co@@ uld@@ n't be sure if he had a large cli@@ tor@@ is or a small pen@@ is and were convinced he could never live a "@@ satisfac@@ tory life@@ " as a man.
So shor@@ tly after his birth in 197@@ 6, Bru@@ c@@ e's external or@@ gan and test@@ es were sur@@ gi@@ cally removed and he was raised as a gir@@ l.
He was given female hor@@ mon@@ es at age 12.
"@@ I knew that I was@@ n't a girl@@ ," he told AB@@ C@@ New@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
I was un@@ happ@@ y, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At 18@@ , he was set for a vag@@ in@@ op@@ last@@ y.
But depressed and knowing something was wrong, he demanded medical record@@ s.
What he found out was horri@@ f@@ y@@ ing.
I was steri@@ li@@ zed at birth -- and no one ever told me.
Bru@@ ce was born with a DS@@ D that prevented his body from producing enough test@@ o@@ ster@@ one to properly develop his gen@@ it@@ als.
After learning the truth, he changed back to a man, taking test@@ o@@ ster@@ one sho@@ ts and having his bre@@ ast@@ s remo@@ ved.
Sur@@ ger@@ y rendered him in@@ fer@@ ti@@ le.
Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Inter@@ face Projec@@ t, trying to normali@@ ze perceptions of those who are inter@@ sex@@ .
But An@@ ne Tam@@ ar-@@ Mat@@ ti@@ s, executive director for Californi@@ a-@@ based legal group Ad@@ voc@@ ates for Inform@@ ed Cho@@ ic@@ e, worries that the German law "@@ inv@@ ites lab@@ eling and stig@@ ma@@ ."
"@@ A lot of activists are concerned that what the German rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an '@@ un@@ determin@@ ed@@ ,@@ '@@ " she sa@@ id.
We are afraid it will encourage intervention.
We think a better process is as@@ signing male or female sex@@ , then wa@@ it@@ ing.
But we ha@@ ven@@ 't seen how the law will play out, so all we can do is specul@@ ate.
Tam@@ ar-@@ Mat@@ tis said that her organization supports the Australian law because "@@ it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gen@@ der@@ ."
"@@ Ad@@ ul@@ ts should be able to make their own decisions about legal gen@@ der@@ ," she sa@@ id.
German law is about as@@ signing it at bir@@ th.
That is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point.
When they are grow@@ n, they can make decisions about their own bo@@ dies.
But Dr. Ar@@ l@@ ene Bar@@ atz@@ , a P@@ it@@ ts@@ bur@@ gh breast radi@@ olog@@ ist who has a daugh@@ ter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said the German law will "@@ empower@@ " both parents and children.
Bar@@ atz@@ 's daugh@@ ter K@@ ati@@ e was born with male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es, but has a DS@@ D called complete and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syn@@ dro@@ me.
Because her and@@ ro@@ gen rec@@ ep@@ tors are faul@@ ty, K@@ ati@@ e developed female character@@ istic@@ s.

"@@ The law gives parents some space not to have to rush into making decisions themsel@@ ves@@ ," said Bar@@ atz@@ .

Un@@ known attack@@ ers inj@@ ure gir@@ l with sho@@ ts fired from car
Un@@ known attack@@ ers have in@@ ju@@ red a t@@ wel@@ ve-@@ year-old gir@@ l in Sa@@ x@@ on@@ y-@@ An@@ halt when fir@@ ing sho@@ ts from a car@@ .
The as@@ sa@@ il@@ ants fired on a group of children on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day ev@@ ening in Gen@@ th@@ in, presumably with an air gun@@ .
This was announced by the police in Bur@@ g.
The gir@@ l suffered minor inj@@ ury to her left cal@@ f.
Res@@ c@@ ue workers took the gir@@ l to the hospit@@ al.
The sho@@ ts came from a small car@@ , which drove past a group of six children and suddenly stopp@@ ed.
Wit@@ nesses saw two people sitting in the car@@ .
The as@@ sa@@ il@@ ants also fired sho@@ ts at a bus stop@@ .
A pan@@ e of gl@@ ass was shat@@ ter@@ ed.
They then drove away.
The Criminal Inv@@ es@@ tig@@ ation Department is investig@@ ating the matter, it was stated on Fri@@ day.
Th@@ us far, the K@@ emp@@ ten Poli@@ ce Department can look back on a calm Hal@@ lo@@ ween nigh@@ t.
The authorities were only called out twice to deal with children throwing eg@@ gs against hous@@ es.
Because the home owners re@@ alis@@ ed this immedi@@ ately, the eg@@ g rem@@ n@@ ants could be clean@@ ed off at on@@ ce, meaning that no material damage occur@@ red.
Furthermore, in the town cent@@ re area, while a few fire@@ works were set off, no material damage was caused here either.
The residents of the B@@ isch@@ of-@@ Freund@@ or@@ fer@@ -@@ Weg reported that a car was w@@ ra@@ pped in to@@ i@@ let paper and its whe@@ el tri@@ ms stol@@ en.
However, the man found all his whe@@ el tri@@ ms near@@ by prior to the police arri@@ ving, on account of which no further police involvement was require@@ d.
Li@@ ving with a futu@@ re-@@ oriented perspective
If truth be tol@@ d, Wal@@ trau@@ d Ri@@ es, lives a dream@@ y life.
Her house is located in a peaceful neigh@@ bour@@ hood in St@@ ut@@ t@@ gar@@ t, with plenty of green@@ er@@ y, an old tre@@ e population, ni@@ ce neigh@@ bo@@ urs and not too much traff@@ ic.
She is only a few min@@ utes from the city cent@@ re using public transpor@@ t.
"@@ Hop@@ efully you aren@@ 't afraid of spi@@ der@@ s@@ ?" as@@ ks Wal@@ trau@@ d Ri@@ es, pointing out a large spi@@ der on the door fra@@ me.
I have been looking for a new home for my hus@@ band and my@@ self for some time now.
But you know how difficult that is in St@@ ut@@ t@@ gar@@ t.
However, the reason for the desire to move is not ar@@ ach@@ no@@ pho@@ bi@@ a, but rather the fear of not being able to manage the large number of steps up to their hous@@ e, and inside their home in their old age, she expla@@ in@@ ed.
Fur@@ ther@@ mor@@ e: Since under@@ going a men@@ is@@ c@@ us oper@@ ation, the lad@@ y, in her mid-@@ fif@@ ties, has had to experience for her@@ self what it means to move from flo@@ or to flo@@ or with a dis@@ ability.
Only recently, she released a book on the subject of "@@ Li@@ ving happ@@ ily in old age - Wh@@ ich type of property is the best for me@@ ?@@ ".
"@@ Our home is the best example of a property that simply does@@ n't work in old age@@ ," she begins to re@@ coun@@ t.
When she moved to the ma@@ is@@ on@@ ette with her hus@@ band 20 years ago, it was simply just a pretty apar@@ tment in green surround@@ ings.
Now, in her mid-@@ fif@@ ties, Wal@@ trau@@ d Ri@@ es has different though@@ ts about it.
However, she is aware that she is one of the few people to actually deal with the top@@ ic of '@@ living in old age@@ '@@ .
The majority of people put it to the back of their minds for as long as possible.
Only other people get old, she say@@ s, sm@@ ir@@ k@@ ing.
Only when the psychological strain becomes severe do people give it consider@@ ation.
"@@ But at this stage it can be too lat@@ e@@ ," said Ri@@ es.
In her book, the inter@@ ior dec@@ or@@ ator presents 17 housing models for independent living in old age.
"@@ However, which type of residen@@ ce you choose is always a personal decision@@ ," she expla@@ in@@ s.
There is no solution to overcoming old age.
Even if you can afford to spend your retirement in Tus@@ c@@ any or Brit@@ tan@@ y, you should always take the fact that you may become ill into consider@@ ation.
An@@ d: '@@ Without a sound knowledge of the local language, you can even become lon@@ ely when living the dol@@ ce vit@@ a@@ ,@@ ' added the auth@@ or, providing food for thought for those seeking to move abroad.
Her models include classic care models, alternative living arrangements and the of@@ ten-@@ mentioned pension@@ ers@@ ' living community.
In old age everyone has their qu@@ ir@@ ks and tick@@ s.
'@@ However, this type of residential community would not be for me@@ ,@@ ' she comment@@ ed with a win@@ k.
Def@@ in@@ it@@ ely nothing like student accommod@@ ation with a shared b@@ ath@@ room and kit@@ chen.
'@@ In old age you simply need your own space to withdraw to@@ ,@@ ' said Ri@@ es.
However, the author does not wish to rule out the possibility that a pension@@ ers@@ ' residential community can work.
However, it must operate differently to the classic student dig@@ s.
And sometimes you also just want your peace and quiet@@ ,@@ ' she believ@@ es.
With this opinion she is at least not alone in the State Capit@@ al.
The experience of Ther@@ esa R@@ Ã¼t@@ ten, head of the citizen@@ 's Life in Old Age service in the State Capit@@ al, is also that '@@ the majority of old people in St@@ ut@@ t@@ gar@@ t want to remain in their own homes for as long as possi@@ ble@@ '@@ .
Her agency agency advis@@ es people on the top@@ ic of '@@ growing ol@@ d@@ '@@ .
There@@ fore the experience of the Stiftung War@@ ent@@ est consumer study is also that elderly people in particular would accept in@@ conveni@@ ences and limit@@ ations just to be able to remain in their usual environment.
Nowad@@ ays there are many possibilities for desig@@ ning the house or apar@@ tment in such a way as to be bar@@ rier@@ -@@ free.
Ri@@ es recommen@@ ds that all those working on the age-@@ appropriate ren@@ ov@@ ation of their house or apar@@ tment first seek out in-@@ depth information and don't simply use the first tra@@ des@@ man that comes along@@ .
Nowad@@ ays there are speci@@ alists in ren@@ ov@@ ation to suit the needs of the elder@@ ly.
Even in the case of r@@ ental apar@@ t@@ ments some land@@ l@@ ords can have this work carried out, even if it is just a matter of raising the level of the to@@ i@@ let se@@ at, clari@@ fied the inter@@ ior desig@@ ner.
However, it is not always the case that your existing apar@@ tment can be made age-@@ appropriate and therefore bar@@ rier@@ -@@ free, even if it is as beauti@@ ful as ever.
Wal@@ trau@@ d Ri@@ es had to go through this experience her@@ self@@ .
You could of course inst@@ all a sta@@ ir lift inside the apar@@ t@@ ment, but the co@@ b@@ bled path up to the door of the apar@@ t@@ ment, feat@@ uring a number of steps would be a much greater hin@@ dran@@ ce.
She will keep looking until she has found the ideal property for her@@ self and her hus@@ b@@ and.
She is more afraid of the move than of the spi@@ der on her front do@@ or.
The USA still want to prosecu@@ te Snow@@ den
The USA have not changed their position regarding the former US Secre@@ t Service employe@@ e Edward Snow@@ den.
He is still accused of passing on secret information without auth@@ or@@ is@@ ation.
He must therefore face criminal proceed@@ ings in the USA, said the spo@@ kes@@ person for the US Foreign Off@@ ic@@ e, J@@ en@@ ni@@ fer P@@ sak@@ i, in Washingt@@ on.
Even the most recent statements from Snow@@ den will not change this fac@@ t.
Following a recent meeting with Snow@@ den in Mosco@@ w, German Green Party politician H@@ ans@@ -@@ Christian St@@ rÃ¶@@ bel@@ e appe@@ aled to the USA not to continue to threaten him with prosecu@@ tion.
P@@ sak@@ i emphasi@@ sed that St@@ rÃ¶@@ bel@@ e's com@@ ments were the views of a parliament@@ ari@@ an, and not those of a German government member@@ .
Secre@@ t Service wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ , Edward Snow@@ den is, in principle, willing to hold a discussion with the German authorities.
However, he first wishes for his situation to be clari@@ fied.
This was made clear by the former N@@ SA employe@@ e, currently sought by the USA, in an open letter that Green Party politician H@@ ans@@ -@@ Christian St@@ rÃ¶@@ bel@@ e made public on Fri@@ day following a meeting with Snow@@ den, and passed on to the Federal Govern@@ ment, the Federal Parliament and the Federal Public Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ or Gener@@ al.
The letter was pur@@ por@@ ted to have been wor@@ ded as follow@@ s:
To whom it may conc@@ ern,
I have been invited to write to you regarding your investigation of mass surveill@@ ance.
I am Edward Joseph Snow@@ den, form@@ erly employed through contracts or direct hire as a technical expert for the United States National Security Agen@@ cy, and Defense Intelligence Agen@@ cy.
In the course of my service to these organizations, I believe I witnessed systemic violations of law by my government that created a moral duty to act.
As a result of reporting these concerns, I have faced a severe and sustained campaign of persecu@@ tion that forced me from my family and home.
I am currently living in ex@@ ile under a grant of temporary asylum in the Russian Feder@@ ation in accord@@ ance with international law.
I am hear@@ ten@@ ed by the response to my act of political expres@@ sion, in both the United States and beyond.
Citiz@@ ens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the revel@@ ation of an un@@ accountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public servic@@ e.
These sp@@ ying revel@@ ations have resulted in the proposal of many new laws and policies to address form@@ erly conc@@ e@@ aled abuses of the public tru@@ st.
The benefits to society of this growing knowledge are becoming increasingly clear at the same time that claimed risks are being shown to have been mitig@@ ated.
Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstra@@ bly posi@@ tive, my government continues to treat dis@@ sent as defec@@ tion, and seeks to crimin@@ alize political speech with fel@@ ony charges that provide no def@@ ence.
However, speaking the truth is not a cri@@ me.
I am confident that with the support of the international community, the government of the United States will abandon this harmful behavi@@ our@@ .
I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resol@@ ved, I will be able to cooperate in the responsible finding of facts regarding reports in the media, particularly with regard to the truth and auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity of docum@@ ents, as appropriate and in accord@@ ance with the law.
I look forward to speaking with you in your country when the situation is resol@@ ved, and th@@ ank you for your efforts in up@@ holding the international laws that protect us all.
Edward Snow@@ den, as witnessed by H@@ ans@@ -@@ Christian St@@ rÃ¶@@ bel@@ e

Re@@ port@@ : Obama campaign considered dump@@ ing Bi@@ den for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obam@@ a's closest advisers secre@@ tly considered replacing Vice President Jo@@ e Bi@@ den with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 tick@@ et, according to the New York Tim@@ es.
The revel@@ ation is the most notable bomb@@ sh@@ ell from Mark Hal@@ per@@ in and John Hei@@ le@@ mann@@ 's heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tom@@ e, "@@ D@@ ou@@ ble Dow@@ n: G@@ ame Change 201@@ 2.@@ "
The Times obtained a cop@@ y of the forth@@ coming book and reported Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day ev@@ ening that the Presid@@ ent's top ai@@ des conducted "@@ extensive group@@ -@@ s@@ essions and poll@@ ing in late 201@@ 1@@ " to g@@ au@@ ge whether the dump@@ ing Bi@@ den could help bolster Obam@@ a's wan@@ ing re-election hop@@ es.
According to the Tim@@ es' national political cor@@ respon@@ dent J@@ on@@ athan Mar@@ tin@@ , the book provides a thor@@ ough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White Hous@@ e, namely former White House Chief of St@@ af@@ f Bill Dal@@ e@@ y, to measure what effect sw@@ apping former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President would have in the poll@@ s.
The potential swit@@ ch was a closely guar@@ ded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the O@@ val Off@@ ic@@ e.
Only half a dozen of the Presid@@ ent's closest advisers -- including Dal@@ e@@ y, former Obama campaign chief J@@ im Mes@@ sin@@ a, and former White House senior advisers David A@@ x@@ el@@ ro@@ d and David P@@ lo@@ u@@ ffe -- knew the change was under consider@@ ation.
"@@ D@@ ou@@ ble Dow@@ n@@ " claims Dal@@ ey sp@@ ear@@ headed the effort to replace B@@ id@@ en, despite their "@@ close personal rap@@ port@@ ," before ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding Clinton to the tick@@ et wo@@ uld@@ n't "@@ materi@@ ally improve Obam@@ a's od@@ d@@ s@@ ."
In an inter@@ view with Mar@@ tin@@ , Dal@@ ey confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replacing Bi@@ den with Clint@@ on.
"@@ I was vo@@ cal about looking into a whole bun@@ ch of things, and this was one of them@@ ," Dal@@ ey told the pap@@ er.
You have to remember@@ , at that point the President was in aw@@ ful shap@@ e, so we were lik@@ e, "@@ Hol@@ y Chri@@ st, what do we do@@ ?"
While Dal@@ ey characterized the research as "@@ due di@@ ligen@@ c@@ e@@ ," Martin told CN@@ N@@ 's Ander@@ son Co@@ op@@ er that the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividen@@ ds at the poll@@ s.
"@@ C@@ amp@@ aig@@ ns don't spend the kind of money on poll@@ ing and focus groups unless the@@ y@@ '@@ re seriously considering someth@@ ing@@ ," Martin said on AC@@ 3@@ 60@@ .
It@@ 's un@@ clear, however, whether Obama knew his team was expl@@ oring the sw@@ ap@@ .
Martin told CN@@ N that he asked Dal@@ ey whether his then-@@ bo@@ ss knew about the potential sh@@ u@@ ff@@ le.
While Dal@@ ey said he does@@ n't think the President "@@ was awar@@ e" of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted that it@@ 's "@@ possi@@ ble@@ " Obama k@@ new.
Martin added that "@@ D@@ ou@@ ble Dow@@ n@@ " does not defini@@ tively answer whether the political prob@@ ing reached Obam@@ a's des@@ k.
Co@@ op@@ er asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know about the research into dump@@ ing Bi@@ den from the tick@@ et.
"@@ Po@@ ssi@@ bl@@ y@@ ," Martin rep@@ li@@ ed.
What happens with my e-@@ mail when in transi@@ t?
E-@@ mail is short for electronic ma@@ il.
Are there technical measures to maintain priv@@ acy of cor@@ respon@@ dence, similar to that of the traditional post@@ al service, implemented into the design of this Internet@@ -based servic@@ e?
When desig@@ ning the early Internet services, the focus lay on making communication possible.
Thus, when developing the underlying technical proto@@ col@@ s, no attention was given to creating a stable foundation for the inter@@ cep@@ tion-@@ proof exchange of ma@@ il.
For this reason, a traditional em@@ ail is more like an open post@@ card than a se@@ aled let@@ ter.
When us@@ er "@@ Ann@@ a@@ " sen@@ ds an em@@ ail to "@@ Ben@@ ni@@ ", are the pa@@ ir@@ 's computers then directly connec@@ ted@@ ?
Ann@@ a's em@@ ail program or bro@@ w@@ ser first sen@@ ds the mail to her service provi@@ der@@ 's mail ser@@ ver.
If she has a G@@ mail accoun@@ t, for example, this would be Goog@@ le.
This mail ser@@ ver sen@@ ds the content to the provi@@ der that B@@ enn@@ i us@@ es.
E@@ n rou@@ te, the mail can pass through any number of other ser@@ vers on the Internet.
B@@ enn@@ i can then call up the content from his provi@@ der.
Are traditional e-@@ ma@@ ils read by third parties on their jour@@ ney through the net@@ ?
The majority of e-@@ ma@@ ils are read several times by software robo@@ ts en route to the recipi@@ ent.
Ch@@ ecks are generally carried out by the sen@@ der@@ 's provi@@ der as to whether the mail contains mal@@ ware as an attach@@ ment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the provi@@ ders check whether it is nu@@ is@@ ance or un@@ wanted sp@@ am ma@@ il, which are del@@ eted immediately or at least sor@@ ted into a sp@@ am fol@@ der.
Do the robo@@ ts have other tas@@ ks@@ ?
In the case of systems such as G@@ ma@@ il, the robo@@ ts also identify the information that Google requires for disp@@ laying contex@@ t-@@ based adver@@ tis@@ ing.
If Ann@@ a and B@@ enn@@ i communic@@ ate about their upcoming holi@@ day travel@@ s via G@@ ma@@ il, Google can display cor@@ responding links to holi@@ day off@@ ers.
Do unknown individuals also read the e-@@ ma@@ il@@ s?
The probability of un@@ auth@@ or@@ ised person@@ s reading a mail is extremely low.
However, theore@@ tic@@ ally, it is possible.
Within companies, administ@@ rat@@ ors are often able to read electronic mail that is s@@ ent.
Law enforcement authorities and Secre@@ t Services also have legal auth@@ or@@ is@@ ation to inter@@ cep@@ t or take note of e-@@ ma@@ il@@ s.
This may include potential illegal sp@@ ying activities.
Is it possible to protect e-@@ ma@@ ils against being read@@ ?
With an enc@@ r@@ yp@@ tion using the O@@ pen@@ P@@ G@@ P standard, an e-@@ mail can be effectively protected against being read@@ .
With great technical effort, it is also possible to conc@@ e@@ al the met@@ ad@@ ata of em@@ ail communication so that it is not even possible to tell who is communic@@ ating with wh@@ om@@ .
How important are Y@@ ah@@ o@@ o and Google within the e-@@ mail market in German@@ y?
According to a study conducted by Con@@ vi@@ os Con@@ sul@@ ting in August 2013, among the main mail services in private use, Y@@ ah@@ o@@ o and Google play only a minor role.
While the number of Y@@ ah@@ o@@ o Ma@@ il accounts has fallen recently, Goog@@ le@@ 's G@@ mail managed to grow consider@@ ably.
M@@ other bu@@ ried in shal@@ low forest grave and pension stol@@ en
When his elderly mother di@@ ed, a man from Wolf@@ s@@ burg devis@@ ed a plan.
He bu@@ ried the dec@@ eas@@ ed in a forest - and continued to collect her pension and care allow@@ ance.
According to police investig@@ ations, a 6@@ 7-@@ year-old Wolf@@ s@@ burg res@@ ident bu@@ ried his dead mother in the wo@@ ods in order that he might continue to collect her pension and care allow@@ ance.
He first covered up the death of the 8@@ 9-@@ year-old and then pock@@ eted the money for more than a year and a hal@@ f.
The 6@@ 7-@@ year-old must now face charges of frau@@ d, said a spo@@ kes@@ person on Fri@@ day.
According to the stat@@ ement, the man h@@ id the woman in a forest near Hel@@ m@@ st@@ ed@@ t.
The man was already under suspicion back in Ma@@ y: At that time the fact that medic@@ ations for his car@@ e-@@ reli@@ ant mother were no longer required drew suspici@@ on.
The pension@@ er told investig@@ ators that his mother had tra@@ v@@ elled to Spain@@ .
The officials found this strange and so continued to investig@@ ate.
It was discovered that the mother and son had lived in the same residen@@ ce for more than 15 years and that he had car@@ ed for her in her final days.
The 6@@ 7-@@ year-old finally acknowledged the death of his mo@@ ther.
According to poli@@ ce, an aut@@ op@@ sy showed no evidence of any capital off@@ ence.
F@@ ancy a g@@ low-@@ in-@@ the-@@ dark ice cre@@ am@@ ?
A British entrepreneu@@ r has created the world's first g@@ low-@@ in-@@ the-@@ dark ice cre@@ am - using j@@ ell@@ y@@ fis@@ h.
Charlie Francis has har@@ n@@ essed the flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent proper@@ ties of the marine animal to develop the l@@ um@@ ines@@ cent sn@@ ack@@ .
He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish and convinced scientists in China to chem@@ ically re@@ create the g@@ lowing prot@@ ein.
The ice cre@@ am reac@@ ts with the e@@ ater@@ 's ton@@ gue - raising the p@@ H level in the prot@@ ein and making it g@@ low.
Chri@@ s says because the ice cre@@ am lights up when it reac@@ ts with the heat of the mou@@ th it means the more you li@@ ck, the brigh@@ ter it be@@ com@@ es.
Char@@ li@@ e, founder of the "@@ L@@ ick M@@ e I@@ '@@ m De@@ li@@ ci@@ ous@@ " ice cre@@ am company, sa@@ id@@ : "@@ It is in@@ credible stuf@@ f but still at very early days in terms of production, so Â£@@ 200 gets you about 2@@ g of the stu@@ ff@@ ."
The prot@@ ein we are using in the ice cre@@ am reac@@ ts with your ton@@ gue at neutral p@@ H@@ .
So as your mou@@ th war@@ ms up the prot@@ ein it will raise the p@@ H level and the ice cre@@ am will g@@ low.
We have been testing it out over the past few months and it seemed perfect to share it over Hal@@ lo@@ ween because it gives that won@@ der@@ ful g@@ low effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cre@@ am I have made because the j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish l@@ um@@ ines@@ c@@ ence is four times more expensive than gol@@ d.
So each s@@ co@@ op costs me around Â£@@ 14@@ 0.
It ta@@ stes pretty good though@@ .
Char@@ lie@@ 's experi@@ mental company, based in Bri@@ stol@@ , is fam@@ ed for its unusual f@@ la@@ vo@@ urs including be@@ er, che@@ ese, be@@ ef and gold le@@ af@@ .
But his next creation is set to be even more ambi@@ ti@@ ous.
He sa@@ id@@ : "@@ I really want to develop an in@@ visible ice cre@@ am@@ ."
It is inherently impossible because of the re@@ fraction caused by the ice c@@ ry@@ st@@ als which make up the ice cre@@ am, but I reck@@ on we will find a way of doing it.
The ice cre@@ am har@@ nesses the flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent proper@@ ties of a j@@ ell@@ y@@ fis@@ h, syn@@ th@@ es@@ ized by Chinese scientists

"@@ I hope that we finally have our heads clear@@ ," comment@@ ed E@@ hl@@ ers, remaining cau@@ ti@@ ously optim@@ istic@@ .
For this match he finally has his complete squ@@ ad available, with the exception of H@@ end@@ ri@@ ck Blo@@ h@@ me who is out with long-term inj@@ ur@@ y.
Like us, Da@@ ver@@ den place emphasis on high temp@@ o play.
For this reason, we must keep our error@@ s to a minim@@ um.
However, the top priority is to improve our cover pla@@ y, which has recently left much to be desi@@ red.
Da@@ ver@@ den@@ 's co@@ ach Thomas Pan@@ itz comes across as much more relax@@ ed following his team@@ 's first victory of the seas@@ on against Nord@@ hor@@ n.
The match was of course a indication of what we are capable of@@ .
However, it by no means makes us fa@@ v@@ ou@@ rit@@ es, as anything can happen in the der@@ b@@ y.
Nonetheless, Pan@@ itz is now looking to come up with the goods in Mor@@ sum and thus start a winning stre@@ ak.

Anyone who is not fired up for a game like this should stay at home.
Hal@@ lo@@ ween 201@@ 3@@ : By the Num@@ bers
When I was litt@@ le, Hal@@ lo@@ ween was magi@@ c@@ al.
My si@@ ster and I were allowed to eat c@@ and@@ y, stay up late and play dres@@ s-@@ up for the neighborho@@ od.
Nowadays, I@@ '@@ ve become more of a sc@@ roo@@ ge.
I ha@@ ven@@ 't signed up for the past two years to give out c@@ and@@ y in my apar@@ tment and probably won@@ 't this year.
But stat@@ s show that I@@ '@@ m a black she@@ ep when it comes to Hal@@ lo@@ we@@ en.
The majority of Americans - 15@@ 8 million of them in fact - will be celeb@@ rating Hal@@ lo@@ ween this year, spending a total of $@@ 6.@@ 9 billion on c@@ and@@ y, cost@@ um@@ es and dec@@ or@@ ations, according to the National Ret@@ ail Feder@@ ation.
One thing I do look forward to every Hal@@ lo@@ ween are the tren@@ ds.
Co@@ stum@@ es are expected to account for $1.@@ 2 billion dollars out of the $@@ 6.@@ 9 billion sp@@ ent, according to the N@@ R@@ F.
This year, sex@@ y inan@@ im@@ ate objec@@ ts are all the ra@@ ge.
Women don't have to be sex@@ y professionals any@@ mor@@ e; they can also be sex@@ y fo@@ ods like p@@ iz@@ z@@ a, ham@@ bur@@ gers and car@@ ro@@ ts.
As for men, I expect we will be seeing a lot of z@@ ombi@@ es, thanks to The Wal@@ king De@@ ad and I@@ '@@ ll bet the D@@ af@@ t P@@ unk space men will make it into our In@@ stag@@ ra@@ m fe@@ eds this year.
According to Goog@@ le, the highest search@@ ed cost@@ um@@ es are z@@ ombi@@ es, Bat@@ man, p@@ ir@@ ates and wit@@ ch@@ es.
I gu@@ ess there@@ 's nothing wrong with going tradition@@ al.
We dres@@ sed our do@@ gs up last year and to my amaz@@ ement we were not alone.
In fact, Americans will spend $3@@ 30 million on pe@@ t cost@@ um@@ es this year, according to the N@@ R@@ F.
That@@ 's a lot of iron@@ ic ho@@ t@@ dog dog@@ s.
When it comes to c@@ and@@ y, we don't scre@@ w around.
Americans will spend $1.@@ 9 billion on it this year, according to The N@@ iel@@ sen Com@@ pan@@ y.
That@@ 's around 600 million po@@ unds worth of Her@@ sh@@ ey bar@@ s, l@@ ol@@ li@@ pop@@ s, Mil@@ k D@@ ud@@ s, T@@ wi@@ zz@@ lers and C@@ lar@@ k Bar@@ s.
That@@ 's great news for the 4@@ 1 million trick@@ -@@ or-@@ treat@@ ers set to take over our neighborho@@ ods, according to the U@@ .@@ S. Com@@ mer@@ ce Depart@@ ment.
In fact, we will buy and, who are we k@@ idd@@ ing, consume 90 million po@@ unds of cho@@ col@@ ate during Hal@@ lo@@ we@@ en.
The one thing we don't want to consum@@ e, c@@ and@@ y cor@@ n; and yet nearly 35 million po@@ unds of it are sold around Hal@@ lo@@ we@@ en, according to the National Con@@ f@@ ec@@ tion@@ ers Associ@@ ation.

House fire in Hel@@ m@@ brech@@ ts: Res@@ c@@ ue services re@@ tri@@ eve char@@ red body
The fire service were called out to Hel@@ m@@ brech@@ ts late on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day even@@ ing.
A three-@@ be@@ dro@@ om house in the distric@@ t of H@@ of cat@@ ches fire during the nigh@@ t.
Res@@ c@@ ue workers re@@ tri@@ eve a char@@ red body from the hous@@ e.
During a fire in Hel@@ m@@ bre@@ cht@@ s, rescue services found a char@@ red body in a three-@@ be@@ dro@@ om hous@@ e.
Whether this person was living in the house is as yet un@@ clear, said a police spo@@ kes@@ person in Bay@@ reu@@ th.
L@@ ate on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day even@@ ing, fire broke out on the ground flo@@ or of the hous@@ e.
When the fire service arri@@ ved, the fl@@ ames were already bur@@ sting out of a win@@ dow@@ .
Res@@ c@@ ue workers entered the pre@@ mis@@ es and found the body in a be@@ dro@@ om@@ .
This and another be@@ dro@@ om were completely bur@@ n@@ t out.
The entire ground flo@@ or suffered damage.
There were no other residents at home during the fi@@ re, continued the police spo@@ kes@@ person@@ .
For the time bein@@ g, the house is no longer habit@@ able.
The precise cause of the fire was initially un@@ clear.
Germany's largest national ch@@ urch has launched a campaign adverti@@ sing the minist@@ er@@ 's position.
This comes at the same time as a possible shortage of minist@@ er@@ s: The Protest@@ ant Lu@@ ther@@ an Region@@ al Church of Han@@ over calcul@@ ates that, as things stand, the current number of around 1,@@ 800 past@@ ors will be hal@@ ved by 2030.
For the young people of today, the career is very attractive and offers good future prospec@@ ts, said P@@ ast@@ or Ma@@ this Bur@@ fi@@ en (@@ 4@@ 3@@ ) in a convers@@ ation with the Protest@@ ant Pres@@ s Ser@@ vic@@ e.
It is attractive to be able to determine your own daily working rout@@ ine.
With Bur@@ fi@@ en, the regional ch@@ urch has for first time commission@@ ed a minister to work full time, en@@ de@@ avo@@ uring to inspire young people to study the@@ ology.
At pres@@ ent, fewer and fewer young people are deciding to study the@@ ology after their Ab@@ it@@ ur exam@@ in@@ ations (@@ equivalent to A level@@ s).
Bur@@ fi@@ en puts this down to the process of secular@@ is@@ ation: "@@ Go@@ d@@ 's voice is qui@@ et, the world is lo@@ ud@@ ".
The job is character@@ ised by great freedom and vari@@ et@@ y.
I am the master of my own sch@@ ed@@ ule and can therefore turn my focus to what is important to me.
As pa@@ stor@@ al workers, ministers can be close to people.
They earn as much as teachers and can make a good liv@@ ing.
Of course wages are higher within the private sector, but on the other hand, the@@ ologi@@ ans have a secure employ@@ er.
This would suit the young people of today, as it is not just about your care@@ er, but about having a meaningful job as well.
According to information from the Region@@ al Chur@@ ch, which cover@@ s three quarters of Low@@ er Sa@@ x@@ on@@ y, around 60 past@@ ors reti@@ re every year.
At the same time, around 40 the@@ ology gradu@@ ates begin as vi@@ car@@ s.
In future it may be difficult to fill positions in spar@@ sely populated out@@ lying areas such as Har@@ z, Em@@ s@@ land or Wen@@ d@@ land.
Among other initi@@ atives, Bur@@ fi@@ en wants to organ@@ ise study days for young people, inv@@ iting famous faces who have studied the@@ ology.

George Ker@@ ev@@ an: Europe break@@ -up gives Sco@@ ts choice
Another day, another independence sc@@ are story.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Europe@@ -wide free-@@ travel zone as a condition of EU membership.
C@@ ue stories about pas@@ sport controls at Ber@@ wi@@ ck and a bar@@ bed wir@@ e border along H@@ ad@@ ri@@ an's W@@ all.
True, the Stra@@ th@@ cl@@ y@@ de paper pointed out the possible economic benefits of fre@@ er movement with the rest of Europe, though - predict@@ ably - that did not figure in the head@@ lines.
Nor did anyone point out that the EU member states spend much of their time ben@@ ding their formal rules if it suits them.
Since Scotland is@@ n't in the Schengen area now, continued non-@@ compliance would be a cheap conc@@ ession for Brussels to offer up in return for whatever it really wanted out of the Sco@@ ts.
So, a non-@@ story, then.
And one that is so long in the too@@ th it has become fossi@@ li@@ s@@ ed: I first heard the "@@ independence means pas@@ sport control@@ s" can@@ ard at least 40 years ago.
Yet there is an interesting point lost in this ret@@ elling of a wh@@ is@@ ker@@ y old tal@@ e.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to do Europe's bid@@ ding, any@@ way@@ ?
Why trade London@@ 's yo@@ ke for that of Brussel@@ s, especially now@@ ?
Here is the real European new@@ s: the gre@@ at, post-war plan to unite Europe has finally st@@ alle@@ d.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially de@@ ad.
Across the EU, parties which are dedicated to opposing the EU, or to scra@@ pping the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Euro@@ sc@@ ep@@ tic Alternative for Germany Party - founded only this year - came from nowhere to gra@@ b nearly five million votes in Septem@@ ber@@ 's federal elections, thus effectively kno@@ cking the Free Democrats (@@ equivalent to our own Li@@ b Dem@@ s) out of the Bundest@@ ag@@ .
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has proved a water@@ sh@@ ed.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the stra@@ it@@ j@@ ack@@ et imposed on national economies through adher@@ ence to the common currency, has led many people to think Project Europe has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was true only of Greece.
Rather, the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates fa@@ v@@ oura@@ ble to German exporters - something German politicians want to keep@@ .
Without the possibility of domestic currency devalu@@ ation, southern Europe finds itself with a buil@@ t-@@ in productivity dis@@ advantage vis-Ã -vis Germany.
The only re@@ course is to slas@@ h wages and public spending - spur@@ red on by Berlin@@ .
Beyond the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity mal@@ ais@@ e.
As a result of "@@ green@@ " energy policies imposed by Brussels - code for subsi@@ dis@@ ing French and German energy firms at the consumer@@ 's expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity, and four times as much for gas, as in the United States.
That is a crip@@ pling cost dis@@ advanta@@ ge, as we@@ '@@ ve already seen at Gran@@ gem@@ ou@@ th.
All the wage free@@ zes in the world won@@ 't stop the European petro@@ chemic@@ als industry being ham@@ mer@@ ed by cheap US sh@@ ale g@@ as.
As a result, revolt is bre@@ w@@ ing, especially in France, once the EU's main che@@ er@@ leader.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in chec@@ k, and to give Paris equal bill@@ ing in the world with Washingt@@ on.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a pas@@ sport to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the bat@@ tered French economy strugg@@ l@@ ing.
Res@@ ul@@ t: Marine Le Pen@@ 's righ@@ t-@@ w@@ ing, anti-@@ EU National Front has just won a crucial by-@@ election, kno@@ cking the ruling Soci@@ alists into third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they can@@ 't assume a split on the right will automatically fa@@ v@@ our the left.
What is Le Pen doing with her new@@ found popularity among the French wh@@ ite, working class@@ ?
She wants to use next year@@ 's EU elections to create an anti-@@ EU, anti-@@ common currency bloc across the European Parliament@@ .
If, as is very possible, anti-@@ EU parties do well in these elections, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
Her@@ e's my poin@@ t: some@@ time soon growing anti-@@ EU and anti-@@ common currency feeling in Europe will co@@ al@@ es@@ ce to kill the euro.
The EU won@@ 't dis@@ appe@@ ar, but it will rever@@ t to something more like the loose "@@ Europe of the (S@@ over@@ eign@@ ) Nation@@ s" fa@@ v@@ ou@@ red by General de Gaul@@ le.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro but France and southern Europe will revive their own currencies.
I expect the UK will distance itself from this project, hoping to co@@ sy up to the US.
However, Washingt@@ on@@ 's growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left out in the Atlantic col@@ d.
Where does this leave Scot@@ land@@ ?
We can choose to be a region of (@@ essenti@@ all@@ y) Little Eng@@ land.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels where to get off.
I suspect that Scotland could do well inside a loo@@ ser European arrangement provided we kept our own currency.
Co@@ -@@ operation with other lik@@ e-@@ minded countries will be easier in a non-@@ federal Europe of the Nation@@ s.
Other@@ wise we should consider emul@@ ating Nor@@ way and re@@ taining our economic independence.
The S@@ NP government in Scotland is - remark@@ ab@@ ly-@@ - the most successful anti-@@ austerity political movement in Europe, having won a spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing the cuts proposed (and implement@@ ed) by Labour@@ 's ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Ali@@ sta@@ ir Dar@@ ling and the subsequent Tor@@ y-@@ Li@@ b Dem coali@@ tion.
It would be ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous now for Scotland to vote for independence only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussel@@ s.
E@@ arly pu@@ ber@@ ty@@ : Gro@@ wing older sooner
African@@ -American and His@@ panic girls tend to reach pu@@ ber@@ ty earlier than their white counterpar@@ ts, research show@@ s.
Physi@@ cal changes don't mean pu@@ ber@@ ty is imminent
Ther@@ e's no evidence that hor@@ mon@@ es or other chemic@@ als are to blame
Exper@@ ts think the obes@@ ity epidemic might be one trigger of early pu@@ ber@@ ty
The trend toward early pu@@ ber@@ ty is not as pron@@ ounced with boys
Former CN@@ N cor@@ respon@@ dent P@@ at Eth@@ eri@@ dge is a journalist speci@@ alizing in children@@ 's health and family issues.
Should a mother be al@@ armed if her daugh@@ ter begins to s@@ pro@@ ut breast bu@@ ds and pub@@ ic ha@@ ir at 7 or 8@@ ?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pe@@ di@@ atri@@ cs this week in Or@@ land@@ o, Flori@@ da, pedi@@ atri@@ c en@@ doc@@ rin@@ olog@@ ist Dr. Paul K@@ ap@@ lo@@ witz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new nor@@ m.
"@@ I spend a lot of time reass@@ uring parents -- usu@@ ally, this does not signal a rapid progres@@ sion into full pu@@ ber@@ ty@@ ," said K@@ ap@@ lo@@ witz@@ .
Ob@@ vious signs of development, such as bud@@ ding bre@@ ast@@ s, pub@@ ic and under@@ arm ha@@ ir and body od@@ or are appear@@ ing sooner in girl@@ s.
But there has been only a s@@ light shift in the age of men@@ ar@@ che (the first peri@@ od@@ ) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 1@@ 2.5 years, down from 1@@ 2.@@ 75 in 1970@@ .
"@@ Once bre@@ ast@@ s begin to develop@@ , it takes at least two to three years before men@@ arch@@ e@@ ," said K@@ ap@@ lo@@ witz@@ , also author of "@@ E@@ arly Pu@@ ber@@ ty in G@@ ir@@ l@@ s: The Es@@ sen@@ tial Gu@@ ide to C@@ op@@ ing with This Common Problem@@ ."
Time is the most accurate test of how pu@@ ber@@ ty is going to progress.
There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of pu@@ ber@@ ty, but it is considered "@@ pre@@ co@@ ci@@ ous@@ " when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spur@@ t before age 8.
In most cases, the process will slow down or st@@ all -- something a pedi@@ atri@@ cian can monitor clo@@ sel@@ y.
A more rapid progres@@ sion may war@@ rant tests by an en@@ doc@@ rin@@ olog@@ ist to rule out serious problems such as tum@@ ors or cy@@ sts.
There are treatments to delay early men@@ ses and ward off another consequ@@ enc@@ e: premature aging of the b@@ ones that ultimately can lead to stun@@ ted growth and being short as an adul@@ t.
Rec@@ om@@ mend@@ ations for drug or hor@@ m@@ one therapy are based on the child@@ 's age, rate of development, growth rate and emotional mat@@ urit@@ y.
P@@ sycho@@ social aspects are important, too.
K@@ ap@@ lo@@ witz is cautious with medic@@ ation but acknowled@@ ges, "@@ sup@@ pressing pu@@ ber@@ ty may allevi@@ ate behavioral issues and girl@@ s' feelings of being different from pe@@ ers@@ ."
The other big issue is understand@@ able: Par@@ ents simply don't want their very young daugh@@ ters having peri@@ od@@ s.
"@@ They worry about the risk of pregn@@ ancy or even how they will handle hy@@ gi@@ ene@@ ," said K@@ ap@@ lo@@ witz@@ .
"@@ It was a shock@@ ," rec@@ alls one woman whose daugh@@ ter started her period at 10@@ .
Even though there were signs and we had talked about men@@ stru@@ ation, she was not emotion@@ ally prepar@@ ed.
She came home from school scar@@ ed and up@@ set to be the first among her friend@@ s.
There are lo@@ ts of well-@@ publi@@ ci@@ zed theories about the causes of pre@@ co@@ cious pu@@ ber@@ ty.
Yet, there@@ 's no consistent body of evidence that hor@@ mon@@ es in mil@@ k or other fo@@ ods, chemic@@ als in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blam@@ e.
Bo@@ ys - like girls - are hit@@ ting pu@@ ber@@ ty ear@@ lier@@ .
K@@ ap@@ lo@@ witz con@@ tends the pre@@ mise that holds the most weight is the epidemic of obes@@ ity.
He helped conduct a 2001 study of 6@@ - to 9-@@ year-old girls that links body fat to the timing of pu@@ ber@@ ty.
Other findings support this conclu@@ sion, but there are many other contributing fac@@ tors.
In this country, African@@ -American and His@@ panic girls tend to reach pu@@ ber@@ ty earlier than their white counterpar@@ ts.
There are var@@ ying explan@@ ations.
Glob@@ ally, patterns of early pu@@ ber@@ ty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to gen@@ es.
Another con@@ und@@ rum@@ : Although boys are getting fac@@ ial and pub@@ ic ha@@ ir at younger ages, the trend toward full-@@ blow@@ n early pu@@ ber@@ ty is not as pron@@ ounced as it is with girl@@ s.
Other doctors atten@@ ding the AA@@ P conference reinforced the comp@@ lexi@@ ties of the top@@ ic.
The appearance of ac@@ ne and pub@@ ic ha@@ ir is common even in inf@@ ants and to@@ dd@@ l@@ ers.
"@@ We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of pu@@ ber@@ ty@@ ," said Dr. Law@@ rence Sil@@ ver@@ man, a pedi@@ atri@@ c en@@ doc@@ rin@@ olog@@ ist at Gor@@ ye@@ b Chil@@ d@@ ren@@ 's Ho@@ sp@@ ital in Mor@@ ri@@ st@@ own, New Jer@@ se@@ y.
Par@@ ents should not hesit@@ ate to get guidance from their pedi@@ atri@@ cian about how to talk with their chil@@ d.
"@@ It may mean having a so@@ on@@ er-@@ th@@ an-@@ expected convers@@ ation@@ ," K@@ ap@@ lo@@ witz advis@@ ed.
If you remain cal@@ m, your child usually will respond well.
G@@ ir@@ ls who b@@ los@@ so@@ m early need reass@@ ur@@ ance that, even when it happens ahead of sch@@ edu@@ le, the process is a normal part of life.
J@@ et makers feu@@ d over seat wid@@ th with big orders at stake
A row has fl@@ ared up between leading plane makers over the wid@@ th of touri@@ st-@@ class seats on long-@@ distance f@@ ligh@@ ts, setting the t@@ one for a bitter confrontation at this month@@ 's Dubai Air@@ show@@ .
The dispute focuses on the wid@@ th of seats provided on long-@@ hau@@ l f@@ lights for economy passen@@ gers - not always the ones most cour@@ ted by air@@ lines, but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest jets offered by Air@@ bus SA@@ S and Bo@@ eing Co@@ .
Air@@ bus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 in@@ ches (@@ 4@@ 6 c@@ m@@ ) wide in economy cabin@@ s, but its U@@ .@@ S. arch@@ -@@ rival Bo@@ eing says it should be for air@@ lines to deci@@ de.
The dispute comes as plane makers vi@@ e to sell ever-@@ larger ver@@ sions of their t@@ win@@ -@@ eng@@ ined long-@@ distance air@@ cra@@ ft, with potentially record orders expected at the November 17@@ -@@ 21 ev@@ ent.
How the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether se@@ ating is 9 or 10 ab@@ re@@ ast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new "@@ min@@ i-@@ jum@@ bo@@ " j@@ et desig@@ ns.
Bo@@ eing says its rev@@ amp@@ ed "@@ 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X@@ " will hold 40@@ 6 people based on economy seats more than 17 in@@ ches wide and set out 10 in each row@@ .
Air@@ bus says the competing version of its A@@ 350 will carry 350 people in 18@@ -@@ in@@ ch-@@ wide economy seat laid out 9 ab@@ re@@ ast@@ .
Plan@@ e gi@@ ants often trade blow@@ s on technical matters through adverti@@ sing in the trade pres@@ s.
Now, Air@@ bus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Air@@ show@@ , where the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X is expected to dominate with more than 100 order@@ s.
It recently pre@@ viewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing financi@@ ers a sli@@ de illustrat@@ ing three people squ@@ ash@@ ed together at a restau@@ ran@@ t, tit@@ led "@@ Would You Acc@@ ep@@ t Th@@ is@@ ?"
"@@ Bo@@ eing is proposing long-@@ distance fl@@ ying in seats nar@@ ro@@ wer than regional tur@@ bo@@ -@@ pro@@ p@@ s@@ ," said Air@@ bus sales chief John Le@@ ah@@ y.
As di@@ ets change, people get bigger but plane se@@ ating has not radically changed.
Between the early 1970@@ s, when the Bo@@ eing 7@@ 4@@ 7 jum@@ b@@ o defined modern long-@@ hau@@ l travel@@ , and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American 40@@ - to 4@@ 9-@@ year-old male increased by 10 per cent@@ , according to U@@ .@@ S. Health Department Dat@@ a.
The wa@@ ist of the average 2@@ 1@@ st-@@ century American male is 3@@ 9.@@ 7 in@@ ch@@ es, according to U@@ .@@ S. health statisti@@ cs.
Air@@ bus says its rival is sti@@ cking to a seat concept from the 1950@@ s, when the average gir@@ th of the newly chri@@ st@@ ened "@@ j@@ et set@@ " was nar@@ rower@@ .
Air@@ bus says it has commission@@ ed research suggesting an extra in@@ ch in seat wid@@ th impro@@ ves sle@@ ep quality by 5@@ 3 per cent@@ .
Bo@@ eing disputes Air@@ bus@@ 's figures on seat measure@@ ments and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how air@@ lines balance far@@ es and facili@@ ties.
It also says research shows c@@ ab@@ in experience depends on more than the wid@@ th of a se@@ at.
"@@ It really comes down to providing flexibility to air@@ lines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be success@@ ful@@ ," said Bo@@ eing c@@ ab@@ ins expert K@@ ent Cra@@ ver.
They don't want us to dict@@ ate to them what makes them profit@@ able.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For fl@@ yers it is about more el@@ bo@@ w room@@ , but for suppli@@ ers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earn@@ ings.
Behin@@ d the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $@@ 700@@ -@@ billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades, enough to tip the sc@@ ales of U@@ .@@ S. and European exports.
As Re@@ u@@ ters first reported in July, seat lay@@ out is exactly what drives the battle between the latest jet@@ s.
Both Air@@ bus and Bo@@ eing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest t@@ win@@ -@@ eng@@ ined long-@@ hau@@ l desig@@ ns than the market leader in that seg@@ ment, the 3@@ 6@@ 5-@@ seat Bo@@ eing 7@@ 7@@ 7-@@ 300@@ ER@@ .
Bo@@ ein@@ g@@ 's performance claims depend in part on compar@@ ing the 10-@@ ab@@ re@@ ast 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X with an original 9-@@ ab@@ re@@ ast 7@@ 7@@ 7 desig@@ n.
The gain in unit costs is bl@@ un@@ ted compared with 10-@@ ab@@ re@@ ast now in use.
"@@ The reason Bo@@ eing are doing this is to cra@@ m more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our produc@@ ts@@ ," said K@@ ev@@ in Ken@@ ist@@ on, head of passen@@ ger comfort at Europe's Air@@ bus@@ .
On the other hand, analysts say full 10-@@ se@@ at-@@ per@@ -@@ row c@@ ab@@ ins for existing 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ s suggest many passen@@ gers are voting for the den@@ ser la@@ you@@ t, which may go hand in hand with cheaper far@@ es.
"@@ E@@ igh@@ teen in@@ ches in seat wid@@ th would be great for passen@@ ger@@ s, but the reality is that from a business point of the Air@@ bus proposal is driven by the threat of the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ ," said c@@ ab@@ in inter@@ i@@ ors expert M@@ ary Kir@@ by, founder and edi@@ tor of the R@@ un@@ way G@@ ir@@ l Net@@ work.
Air@@ bus and Bo@@ eing do not supply seats but offer a cat@@ alo@@ gue of suppli@@ ers for air@@ lines to choose fro@@ m.

New anti-@@ ni@@ co@@ tin@@ e vaccine could take the pleas@@ ure out of smo@@ king
Scienti@@ sts have developed an anti-@@ ni@@ co@@ tin@@ e vaccine that could take the pleas@@ ure out of smo@@ king a ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te.
A single do@@ se of the vaccine was able to protect mi@@ ce against ni@@ co@@ tin@@ e addic@@ tion for life.
Fur@@ ther tests are needed before starting human tri@@ als, which would take several years, but Professor Ronald C@@ ry@@ st@@ al of Wei@@ ll Cor@@ n@@ ell Medical Col@@ lege in New York said the early signs are good.
"@@ We are very hop@@ eful that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smo@@ kers who have tried to stop@@ , exhau@@ sting all the methods on the market today, but find their ni@@ co@@ tin@@ e addic@@ tion to be strong enough to overcome these current approach@@ es@@ ," Pro@@ f Cor@@ n@@ ell sa@@ id.
The new vaccine contains a harm@@ less virus that has been engine@@ ered to carry the genetic information to make anti-@@ ni@@ co@@ tin@@ e anti@@ bo@@ dies.
The virus selec@@ tively infec@@ ts li@@ ver cell@@ s, which then start to make a steady stream of the anti@@ bo@@ dies.
The anti@@ bodies h@@ unt down any ni@@ co@@ tin@@ e molec@@ ul@@ es in the blood@@ stre@@ am, neutrali@@ sing them before they reached the bra@@ in, preventing a smo@@ ker from getting a ni@@ co@@ tin@@ e h@@ it.
In test@@ s, vacc@@ inated mi@@ ce who were subsequently given ni@@ co@@ tin@@ e continued with their normal activity.
But mi@@ ce who had not been given the vaccine "@@ chill@@ ed out@@ ," say the resear@@ ch@@ ers, a sign that the ni@@ co@@ tin@@ e had reached their bra@@ in@@ s.
The experiments are described in the journ@@ al Science Trans@@ l@@ ational Medic@@ ine.
Pre@@ vious tobacco vaccines failed because they contained anti@@ bo@@ dies.
The j@@ ab@@ s had to be given so frequently to keep anti@@ body levels topp@@ ed up that they proved expensive and imp@@ rac@@ tic@@ al.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be far lower@@ , because it turns li@@ ver cells into anti@@ body fac@@ tori@@ es.
Pro@@ f C@@ ry@@ st@@ al said that if a future human vaccine was completely safe it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te, preventing ni@@ co@@ tin@@ e addic@@ tion.
But more likely it would be used by smo@@ kers to qu@@ it.
"@@ They will know if they start smo@@ king again, they will receive no pleas@@ ure from it due to the ni@@ co@@ tin@@ e vacc@@ ine, and that can help them k@@ ick the habit@@ ," he sa@@ id.
British scientists said the results were interesting but warned far more research was needed.
Tri@@ po@@ di den@@ ies being influenced by O@@ bei@@ d
Former N@@ S@@ W Labor minister Jo@@ e Tri@@ po@@ di will be investig@@ ated by the stat@@ e's corruption watch@@ do@@ g.
Former N@@ S@@ W minister Jo@@ e Tri@@ po@@ di has denied changing maritime le@@ as@@ es policy at the request of his political ment@@ or Ed@@ die O@@ bei@@ d, who had hidden interests in three proper@@ ties on government-@@ controlled land.
The In@@ dependent Commission Against Cor@@ ruption (I@@ CA@@ C) on Fri@@ day widen@@ ed its inqu@@ ir@@ y into whether M@@ r O@@ bei@@ d lobbi@@ ed several state ministers to have le@@ as@@ es at C@@ ir@@ cul@@ ar Qu@@ a@@ y, where the O@@ bei@@ ds owned two restau@@ rants and a c@@ af@@ e, renewed without going to tender after their exp@@ i@@ ration in August 2005.
It@@ 's now investig@@ ating alleg@@ ations M@@ r Tri@@ po@@ di knew of M@@ r O@@ bei@@ d@@ 's secret interest in the proper@@ ties, after evidence given by M@@ r Tri@@ po@@ di@@ 's former deputy chief of staff@@ , L@@ yn@@ ne Ash@@ pol@@ e, on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day.
During years of discussions starting in 2005 the government had been pushing for the le@@ as@@ es to go to public ten@@ der.
The les@@ sees were against this and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009 le@@ as@@ es for the C@@ ir@@ cul@@ ar Qu@@ ay enterpri@@ ses, which earned the O@@ bei@@ ds about $@@ 2.5 million annually, were renewed without going to public ten@@ der.
M@@ r Tri@@ po@@ di, who was ports minister from February 2006 until November 2009, was initially in fa@@ v@@ our of public ten@@ ders.
But he denied the changes were made at the request of M@@ r O@@ bei@@ d, who M@@ r Tri@@ po@@ di acknowledged was ur@@ ging a shift in government le@@ ase policy.
A phone trans@@ crip@@ t tab@@ led in I@@ CA@@ C showed calls in August and September 2007 between M@@ r O@@ bei@@ d, M@@ r Tri@@ po@@ di and Ste@@ ve D@@ un@@ n, a senior bureaucra@@ t who had come into the ports minist@@ ry after working under M@@ r O@@ bei@@ d in the fis@@ heri@@ es depart@@ ment.
"@@ Was the matter being discussed in the course of these tel@@ eph@@ one convers@@ ations the development of the commercial le@@ ase policy@@ ," Assist@@ ant Commission@@ er An@@ th@@ ony W@@ heal@@ y asked M@@ r Tri@@ po@@ di@@ .
"@@ No@@ ," M@@ r Tri@@ po@@ di rep@@ li@@ ed.

Israeli war@@ plan@@ es attack target inside Syria, official says
Israeli war@@ plan@@ es struck a target inside the Syrian port city of Lat@@ ak@@ ia Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day nigh@@ t, a senior administration official con@@ firms to Fox New@@ s.

Foreign workers on 45@@ 7 vis@@ as could under@@ go "@@ genu@@ in@@ en@@ ess@@ " test
A "@@ genu@@ in@@ en@@ ess@@ " test for foreign workers on 45@@ 7 vis@@ as is being considered by the government as it contempl@@ ates expanding a crack@@ down.
The tes@@ t, if adop@@ ted, would be applied through a criteria aimed at preventing 45@@ 7@@ s being used to fill un@@ skilled positions or as a back door way to move family and friends to Australi@@ a.
A government discussion paper was released today as former Labor M@@ P Ma@@ x@@ ine Mc@@ K@@ ew s@@ lam@@ med the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could off@@ end Australi@@ a's neigh@@ bour@@ s.
"@@ Lou@@ d declar@@ ations about '@@ foreigners getting to the back of the qu@@ eu@@ e@@ ' and '@@ Aus@@ sie jobs fir@@ st@@ ' are a very un@@ pleas@@ ant throw@@ back to a time when unions demanded a protected labor market@@ ," she told the Australia India Institute today.
Histor@@ ically, that meant it was white lab@@ our that had to be protected - and if some in the region saw echo@@ es of that historic arti@@ fact, I wo@@ uld@@ n't be surpris@@ ed.
The discussion paper out@@ lines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chri@@ s B@@ ow@@ en.
Immigration Minister B@@ ren@@ dan O@@ '@@ Con@@ nor@@ , who was y@@ ester@@ day in Sri Lank@@ a where he is meeting officials about people smugg@@ ling, has implemented five of the recommended changes with the remain@@ der under consider@@ ation.
If the "@@ genu@@ in@@ en@@ ess@@ " criteria was adopted a vis@@ a applic@@ ant could be scrutin@@ ised about "@@ whether the nomin@@ ation is genuine in circumstances where the nomine@@ e is a relation or personal associ@@ ate of an ow@@ ner or relevant person of the sponsor@@ ing business@@ ."
Bus@@ in@@ esses could also be required to account for the number of 45@@ 7 vis@@ a holders after previously businesses who had intended to spon@@ s@@ or a small number of workers then employed hund@@ re@@ ds.
Meanwhile, a 3@@ 5-@@ year-old Sri Lank@@ an asylum seek@@ er died of a suspected heart attack after arri@@ ving on an asylum bo@@ at at Christ@@ mas Island this week@@ .

A study aim@@ ing to increase the benefits to Scotland of the H@@ S@@ 2 ra@@ il project has been announced by the UK government.
The work by H@@ S@@ 2 L@@ t@@ d suggests high-@@ speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Phase One op@@ ens in 20@@ 2@@ 6.
Transport minister Bar@@ on@@ ess Kra@@ mer said the project would "@@ bring the UK toge@@ ther@@ ."
Scot@@ tish transport minister K@@ ei@@ th Brown said he was "@@ exc@@ it@@ ed@@ " to work with the UK government on the plan.
Phase One will consi@@ st of a new high speed ra@@ il line between London and the West M@@ id@@ lands.
When Phase Two is comple@@ ted, lines will run to Man@@ chest@@ er and Le@@ ed@@ s.
In June the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-@@ speed link between London and the North of England from Â£@@ 3@@ 2.@@ 7@@ b@@ n to Â£@@ 4@@ 2.@@ 6@@ b@@ n.
The UK government, which has been holding talks with Transport Scot@@ land, has instruc@@ ted H@@ S@@ 2 L@@ t@@ d to look at further ra@@ il capacity and jour@@ ney time improvements for northern England and Scot@@ land.
This is to include the possibility of eventual jour@@ ney times from G@@ las@@ go@@ w and Ed@@ in@@ bur@@ gh to London of three hours or less.
Bar@@ on@@ ess Kra@@ mer sa@@ id@@ : "@@ Our goal for H@@ S@@ 2 is for a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer toge@@ ther@@ ."
We are driving forward H@@ S@@ 2 because the benefits it will bring are hu@@ ge.
Without it we face a crisis in capacity on our ra@@ il net@@ work.
But it is also about connec@@ tiv@@ ity, across the UK 18 cities including G@@ las@@ go@@ w and Ed@@ in@@ bur@@ gh will be better connected because of H@@ S@@ 2.
Scot@@ tish Secretary Ali@@ sta@@ ir C@@ arm@@ ich@@ ael ad@@ de@@ d: "@@ Toda@@ y's announcement is good news for Scot@@ land@@ ."
For the Scot@@ tish government, K@@ ei@@ th Brown called on M@@ r C@@ arm@@ ich@@ ael to "@@ un@@ equi@@ vo@@ call@@ y" back Scot@@ land@@ 's inclusion in the H@@ S@@ 2 net@@ work.
M@@ r Brown sa@@ id@@ : "@@ High speed ra@@ il has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scot@@ land, but also adds Scot@@ land@@ 's economic weight to the overall case for high speed ra@@ il across Britain@@ ."
So we are exc@@ ited to work in partnership with the UK Government to examine options for bringing high speed ra@@ il to Scot@@ land, creating benefit for all and complement@@ ing the G@@ las@@ go@@ w@@ -@@ Ed@@ in@@ bur@@ gh line which the Scot@@ tish Government is already plann@@ ing.
I look forward to re@@ viewing the report of the investigation with UK ministers next year and together decide on the next step@@ s.
Air@@ craft electronic de@@ vice rules to stay in force in Australia for now
Australian air@@ line passen@@ gers will need to continue turning off their t@@ able@@ ts and smart phones during tak@@ e-@@ off and landing despite moves in the US to loo@@ sen regulations covering the devic@@ es.
The US Federal Avi@@ ation Administration has left the way open for American car@@ ri@@ ers to change their procedures so that passen@@ gers will be able to read e-@@ book@@ s, watch vide@@ os or play gam@@ es on their de@@ vices during critical phas@@ es of flight provided they remain in "@@ air@@ plan@@ e" mo@@ de.
Pas@@ sen@@ gers can already do this during the bulk of a flight but many people find it anno@@ ying to be unable to access their e-@@ books during tak@@ e-@@ offs and land@@ ings.
Australian car@@ ri@@ ers are looking at the decision, which requires US car@@ ri@@ ers to undertake a massive amount of work to meet the require@@ ments, but have indicated they have no immediate plans to change their proced@@ ures.
The Civil Avi@@ ation Saf@@ ety Authority also said it was looking at the announcement but emphasi@@ sed that restrictions on the use of electronic de@@ vices in critical phas@@ es of flight were still in place in Australi@@ a.
"@@ CA@@ SA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic de@@ vices in air@@ cra@@ ft@@ ," it sa@@ id.
The issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft oper@@ ators to ensure safety is maintained at all times and passen@@ gers to comp@@ ly with the safety instruc@@ tions given by cre@@ w members.
Vir@@ g@@ in, which has already been talking to CA@@ SA about extending the use its in-@@ flight wi@@ -@@ fi entertain@@ ment system, was am@@ enable to a change but said it would take its lead from the regulator@@ .
"@@ We would welcome a review by CA@@ SA into allowing the use of electronic de@@ vices because we really do think it will improve the custom@@ er experience now that we have (@@ wir@@ eless in-@@ flight entertain@@ ment@@ ) on our plan@@ es@@ ," a spo@@ kes@@ man sa@@ id.
Q@@ ant@@ as said it would stick with the current rules for now.
"@@ Our current policy is that electronic de@@ vices cannot be used during tak@@ e-@@ off and landing and we have no immediate plans to change that@@ ," it sa@@ id.
The F@@ A@@ A ruling applies to American air@@ lines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passen@@ gers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the F@@ AA@@ 's decision and the reasons behind it.
For US car@@ ri@@ ers, the impact of the ruling will vary from air@@ line to air@@ line and will depend on the age of their fle@@ et.
Car@@ ri@@ ers will need to prove their plan@@ es can tolerate radi@@ o interference from mobile de@@ vices as well as revis@@ e manu@@ als, training materi@@ als, car@@ r@@ y-@@ on bag@@ g@@ age programs and passen@@ ger brief@@ ings.
"@@ Once an air@@ line veri@@ fies the tolerance of its fle@@ et, it can allow passen@@ gers to use hand@@ hel@@ d, ligh@@ t@@ weight electronic de@@ vices such as t@@ able@@ ts, e-@@ re@@ a@@ ders, and smar@@ t@@ ph@@ on@@ es-@@ at all al@@ titu@@ des@@ ," the F@@ A@@ A sa@@ id.
In rare inst@@ ances of low visi@@ bility, the cre@@ w will instruc@@ t passen@@ gers to turn off their de@@ vices during land@@ ing.
The group also recommended that he@@ a@@ vier de@@ vices should be saf@@ ely st@@ owed under seats or in over@@ head b@@ ins during tak@@ e-@@ off and land@@ ing.
Tra@@ v@@ elling B@@ V@@ B f@@ ans created terrible sc@@ enes with fl@@ ar@@ es in the V@@ el@@ tin@@ s Ar@@ ena before the distric@@ t der@@ by against Sch@@ al@@ ke
Bor@@ us@@ sia Dor@@ t@@ m@@ und announced that there would be serious consequences.
Before Fri@@ da@@ y's Bundes@@ lig@@ a match against V@@ f@@ B St@@ ut@@ t@@ gar@@ t, the '@@ Ul@@ tra@@ s' responded with silence - initi@@ ally.
It was an un@@ usu@@ al, almost gh@@ ost@@ ly atmosphere that the f@@ ans created until shor@@ tly before the kick@@ -@@ off of the Bundes@@ lig@@ a match between the German run@@ ner@@ s-@@ up Bor@@ us@@ sia Dor@@ t@@ men@@ d and V@@ f@@ B St@@ ut@@ t@@ gar@@ t, in the Signal I@@ dun@@ a Park@@ .
It was mainly the chan@@ ts of away f@@ ans that could be hear@@ d.
The south stand, on the other hand, where the most loyal - and the lo@@ u@@ dest - of B@@ V@@ B f@@ ans stand, was initially un@@ usually quiet@@ : No sing@@ ing and no battle cri@@ es.
The '@@ Ca@@ po@@ '@@ s' po@@ di@@ um, the individual who usually coordin@@ ates the un@@ is@@ on chan@@ ts, remained emp@@ ty.
And right at the fron@@ t, on the stand, a single large f@@ lag with the text "@@ Stadi@@ um Ban Sec@@ tion@@ " ble@@ w in the win@@ d.
Only when go@@ al@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ ell@@ er, was the first B@@ V@@ B player to step onto the fiel@@ d, did che@@ ers brief@@ ly erup@@ t, as is usually the case.
When his team m@@ ates follow@@ ed, there was lo@@ ud sing@@ ing and scar@@ ves were wa@@ ving - but by no means everywhere.
In the central blocks of the south stand, blocks 12 and 1@@ 3, nothing mo@@ ved.
Even stadi@@ um announc@@ er, Nor@@ bert Di@@ ck@@ el, speaking once again of the successful results in recent days - the der@@ by vic@@ tory, the win against Arsen@@ al, the contract extension of co@@ ach J@@ Ã¶r@@ gen k@@ lo@@ p@@ p - did not raise spi@@ rit@@ s.
Just five min@@ utes before kick@@ -@@ off, the Cap@@ o clim@@ bed onto his po@@ di@@ um - and the tension that had been almost tangible up until that point, lifted with a large sh@@ out, as Di@@ ck@@ el asked for a sh@@ out from each sec@@ tion of f@@ ans as usu@@ al.
As al@@ ways, the south stand was left until the end, and finally the stand resum@@ ed its usual role as the lo@@ u@@ dest sec@@ tion of the stadi@@ um.
And as soon as the vo@@ ci@@ fer@@ ous request for "@@ der@@ by winners stand up@@ " came from the south stand upon kick@@ -@@ off, everything was back to norm@@ al.
The previous silence was indeed a reaction to the events of previous days.
Im@@ medi@@ ately before the local distric@@ t der@@ by against F@@ C Sch@@ al@@ ke 0@@ 4, some of the tra@@ v@@ elling B@@ V@@ B f@@ ans fired fl@@ ar@@ es into the crow@@ ds of spec@@ t@@ ators and onto the pit@@ ch - and in so doing almost hit go@@ al@@ keep@@ er Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ ell@@ er.
The kick@@ -@@ off was delayed on account of the chao@@ tic scen@@ es,
As a result, B@@ V@@ B Chairman H@@ ans Jo@@ ach@@ im W@@ atz@@ ke had invited the heads of the Dor@@ t@@ m@@ und Ul@@ tra@@ s f@@ an group to his office - and if W@@ atz@@ ke@@ 's words are to be believ@@ ed, this was a rather un@@ comfortable meeting for the f@@ an represent@@ atives.
"@@ There will be massive impact for the entire Ul@@ tra movem@@ ent@@ ," announced the B@@ V@@ B Chairman on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day ev@@ ening at a panel discussion in Frankfur@@ t.
As an immediate measu@@ re, W@@ atz@@ ke prohi@@ bited the Ul@@ tra@@ s from organis@@ ing ch@@ ore@@ o@@ graph@@ y for the home match against V@@ f@@ B St@@ ut@@ t@@ gar@@ t.
"@@ I have banned it@@ ," he expla@@ in@@ ed.
We cannot ignore the zero tolerance policy regarding p@@ y@@ ro@@ techni@@ cs in Sa@@ x@@ on@@ y.
In addition, the Ul@@ tra@@ s were given the option of several different punish@@ ments - they now have until Tu@@ es@@ day to decide which one to accep@@ t.
Other@@ wise B@@ V@@ B will impose a sanc@@ tion by the end of next week, said W@@ atz@@ k@@ e.
"@@ It will be sever@@ e@@ ," assured W@@ atz@@ k@@ e.
It will be interesting to see the reactions in the south stand then.
P@@ aw@@ n@@ bro@@ kers sh@@ ine in Singapore as middle class feel the pin@@ ch
At a pa@@ w@@ n@@ sho@@ p in Ben@@ de@@ me@@ er sh@@ opping cent@@ re in Singapore, Jan@@ ani Am@@ ir@@ thal@@ ing@@ a is sw@@ apping a gold b@@ ang@@ le, ring and pa@@ ir of ear@@ r@@ ings to pay her daugh@@ ters@@ " school fe@@ es.
"@@ My hus@@ band and I have just bought a house so all my money@@ 's stuck there@@ ," Mr@@ s Am@@ ir@@ thal@@ ing@@ a say@@ s.
Even though she ear@@ ns S@@ $3@@ ,000 ($@@ 2,@@ 400@@ ) a month as an administ@@ rat@@ or and her hus@@ band works as well, the monthly family income is in@@ suffici@@ ent, she say@@ s.
Indeed, such is demand across parts of sou@@ theast Asia - where household debt is rising - that V@@ alu@@ e@@ Ma@@ x@@ , where she is carrying out her trans@@ action, this week became the third pa@@ w@@ n@@ sho@@ p to list on the Singapore stock ex@@ change.
P@@ aw@@ ning je@@ well@@ ery is not merely a fast way to land cash - S@@ $@@ 1,@@ 300 in M@@ s Am@@ ir@@ thal@@ ing@@ a's case - but almost as cheap as un@@ secured bank loans.
Typ@@ ically pa@@ w@@ n@@ bro@@ kers in Singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent@@ , just above the 15@@ .@@ 4 per cent offered at United Over@@ se@@ as Bank, a local lender with a bran@@ ch in the same sh@@ opping cent@@ re.
However, pa@@ w@@ n@@ bro@@ kers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of sal@@ ary, and can ar@@ range loans faster than banks.
H@@ ence millions of people across the region are turning to pa@@ w@@ n@@ sh@@ ops as families feel the squee@@ ze from rising living costs and ballo@@ oning household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fu@@ elled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, lower@@ - and middle-income families are turning to pa@@ wn sh@@ ops to make up the difference as their economies slow@@ .
This week Standard & Po@@ or@@ 's, the rating agen@@ cy, cited increasing household lever@@ age, mainly from rising mortg@@ ages, as a risk factor for Asian bank@@ s" credi@@ t@@ worth@@ ines@@ s.
It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product ratios in Asia.
Malaysia topp@@ ed the list at 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also worried about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week narrow@@ ly emerged from technical recession.
On Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day, data showed continued export weak@@ ness, and a sof@@ ten@@ ing in consumer demand.
"@@ Bo@@ ttom line is that with costs rising, people in the middle to lower end [@@ of the income scal@@ e@@ ] will be looking to supp@@ lement their income wherever they can@@ ," says S@@ ong Sen@@ g W@@ un, economist at C@@ IM@@ B, a Malay@@ sian bank.
Histor@@ ically high prices for gold in the past two years have added to the rush to pa@@ wn personal belong@@ ings, as people take the opportunity to cash in the value of their family je@@ well@@ er@@ y.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of items pa@@ w@@ ned at the cit@@ y-@@ stat@@ e's 200 pa@@ wn out@@ lets are gol@@ d.
People are saying "the gold price looks good, let@@ 's pa@@ wn grand@@ ma@@ 's gold chain and get it back next month.
In Thailand the largest pa@@ w@@ n@@ sho@@ p oper@@ ator, E@@ asy@@ Mon@@ e@@ y, has seen an up to 20 per cent rise in the number of customers using its out@@ lets in recent months.
Such is the growth in the pa@@ wn business that V@@ alu@@ e@@ Ma@@ x@@ , oper@@ ator of the out@@ let at Ben@@ de@@ me@@ er and of 15 others like it in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neigh@@ bo@@ uring Malaysia - where it has four sh@@ ops - but outside Asia too, says Y@@ e@@ ah Lee Ch@@ ing, V@@ alu@@ e@@ Ma@@ x@@ 's executive direc@@ tor.
The company will fund that by using 60 per cent of S@@ $@@ 6@@ 6@@ m it raised this week in a li@@ sting on the Singapore stock ex@@ change.
While some dis@@ count lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, M@@ s Y@@ e@@ ah says that not only does pa@@ w@@ ning offer cheaper rates than other len@@ ders, it also does not add directly to debt.
"@@ C@@ ustom@@ ers are mortg@@ aging items that they already own, and mone@@ ti@@ sing personal assets does not increase household deb@@ t@@ ," she say@@ s.
Ther@@ e's an increased social acceptance of pa@@ w@@ n@@ bro@@ king as a means to secure short term, secured financing.
Nor are the types of people who use pa@@ w@@ n@@ bro@@ kers only the financially stret@@ ch@@ ed.
We@@ al@@ thy people in Singapore also use V@@ alu@@ e@@ Ma@@ x out@@ le@@ ts, pa@@ w@@ ning gold bar@@ s or Rol@@ e@@ x watch@@ es, which can command up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cas@@ h.
We see customers from all wal@@ ks of life.
"@@ They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short term for business vent@@ ures or investments, or small businesses with a need to tide over their cash flow need@@ s@@ ," says M@@ s Y@@ e@@ ah.
Sometimes they just need the money very quickly.

$3@@ 25@@ m rescue package for T@@ as@@ sie health
The Federal Government insists a $3@@ 25 million rescue package for T@@ as@@ mani@@ a's ailing health system has tough conditions attach@@ ed that will ensure the State Government can@@ 't waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister T@@ anya P@@ liber@@ se@@ k has announced the Com@@ mon@@ wealth is taking "@@ urgent ac@@ tion@@ " to head off a crisis caused by the island stat@@ e's aging population, higher rates of chronic disease and system constrain@@ ts.
The fund@@ ing, over four years, was decided after government consult@@ ations with T@@ as@@ man@@ ian independent M@@ P Andrew Wil@@ ki@@ e.
"@@ The Government has come up with an emergency rescue package we believe will address the unique challenges faced by the stat@@ e@@ ," M@@ s P@@ liber@@ se@@ k said today.
The $3@@ 25 million package includes a $3@@ 1 million elec@@ tive surger@@ y bli@@ tz@@ .
An additional 2@@ 600 operations including or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c and cat@@ ar@@ act surger@@ y will help clear a back@@ lo@@ g.
Ther@@ e's also money for wal@@ k-@@ in clin@@ ics in H@@ ob@@ art and La@@ unc@@ est@@ on, better after@@ -@@ hospital care, medical speci@@ alist training, mental health services and the ro@@ l@@ lout of personal electronic health record systems in local hospit@@ als.
"@@ These investments respond to the ideas that front-@@ line clin@@ ici@@ ans have told me will be the best ways to tend to T@@ as@@ mani@@ a's health system@@ ," M@@ s P@@ liber@@ se@@ k sa@@ id.
The minister insisted the T@@ as@@ man@@ ian Government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state would have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Com@@ mon@@ wealth cash and report monthly on where it was spending the extra funds.
A three-@@ person commission will be set up to ensure the state is delivering services as effectively and effici@@ ently as possible.
M@@ r Wil@@ k@@ ie today said the $3@@ 25 million would count for little "@@ unless it@@ 's followed by genuine reform to put T@@ as@@ mani@@ a's public health system on a more sustainable foot@@ ing@@ ."
He ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless pra@@ ised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance which he first raised with the Prime Minister at the beginning of Ma@@ y.
"@@ I@@ '@@ m hop@@ eful the federal assistance package will go a long way towards taking the stat@@ e's public health system off the critical list@@ ," M@@ r Wil@@ k@@ ie sa@@ id.
According to the State Government these additional elec@@ tive procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But federal Opposition health spo@@ kes@@ man Peter Dut@@ ton believes today's announcement is a "@@ b@@ and-@@ aid solu@@ tion@@ ."
"@@ The reason we are here is that the Labor State Government ri@@ pped $4@@ 30 million out of its health system@@ ," he told AB@@ C T@@ V@@ .
You can@@ 't have a state government ri@@ pping out almost half-@@ a-@@ billion dollars and the Com@@ mon@@ wealth put in $@@ 300 million and pre@@ tend it@@ 's a good news day.
M@@ r Dut@@ ton called on M@@ s P@@ liber@@ se@@ k to guarantee that not one dollar out of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucra@@ cy.

Also Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day, a Syrian activist group said more than 1@@ 20,000 people have been killed since the start of the country's civil war nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion of Ch@@ emical We@@ ap@@ ons came one day ahead of the No@@ v.
1 dead@@ line set by The H@@ agu@@ e-@@ based organization for Dam@@ asc@@ us to destroy or "@@ render in@@ oper@@ able@@ " all chemical weapon production facilities and mach@@ in@@ ery for mix@@ ing chemic@@ als into pois@@ on gas and fill@@ ing muni@@ tions.
The comple@@ tion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is a significant mil@@ est@@ one in an ambitious tim@@ el@@ ine that aims to destroy all of Dam@@ asc@@ us@@ ' chemical weapons by mid-@@ 2014.
Dest@@ ruc@@ tion of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Dam@@ asc@@ us still has to start destroying existing weapons and stock@@ pil@@ es.
The country is believed to have around 1,000 met@@ ri@@ c tons of chemic@@ als and weapons including mu@@ star@@ d gas and the ner@@ ve ag@@ ent sar@@ in.
The announcement came as fighting ra@@ ged Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day in the town of Saf@@ ira@@ , which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage si@@ tes, reported the Britain@@ -based Syrian Ob@@ serv@@ atory for Human Righ@@ ts.
The activist group, which has been tra@@ cking the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day that 1@@ 20@@ ,@@ 2@@ 9@@ 6 people have di@@ ed.
Of tho@@ se, it said 6@@ 1,@@ 0@@ 67 are civili@@ ans, including 6,@@ 3@@ 65 children.
On the government side, it said 2@@ 9,@@ 9@@ 5@@ 4 are members of President Bashar Ass@@ ad@@ 's armed forces, 18@@ ,@@ 6@@ 7@@ 8 are pro-@@ government fighters and 18@@ 7 are Lebanese Hezbollah milit@@ ants.
Also among the dead it said were 2,@@ 20@@ 2 army defec@@ tors and some 5,@@ 3@@ 75 opposition figh@@ ters, many of them foreig@@ ner@@ s.
On July 25, the U@@ .@@ N@@ . estimated 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not up@@ dated that figure sin@@ ce.
The conflict has forced some 2 million people to fle@@ e the country.
Ass@@ ad@@ 's troops have been batt@@ ling rebel@@ s, many of them linked to al-@@ Qaida groups, in Saf@@ ir@@ a for week@@ s.
The Ob@@ serv@@ atory said there were casual@@ ties on both sides Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day but had no specific@@ s.
The fighting underscor@@ ed the dangers the chemical weapon@@ s' inspec@@ tors face as they race against tight dead@@ lines in their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsen@@ al in the midst of an ongoing civil war.
A statement from the OP@@ C@@ W@@ , which works closely with the United Nations, said its team was "@@ now satisfied that it has veri@@ fied - and seen destroyed - all of Syri@@ a's declared critical production and mix@@ ing@@ /@@ fill@@ ing equip@@ ment@@ ."
It added that, "@@ no further inspec@@ tion activities are currently plan@@ ne@@ d@@ ."
Ear@@ lier this week, the inspec@@ tors said they had completed their first round of veri@@ fication work, visi@@ ting 21 of 23 sites declared by Dam@@ asc@@ us.
They were unable to visit two sites because of security concerns, the inspec@@ tors sa@@ id.
On Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day, OP@@ C@@ W said the two loc@@ ations were, according to Syria, "@@ abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items they contained were moved to other declared si@@ tes, which were inspec@@ ted@@ ."
It was not immediately clear if the facility in Saf@@ ir@@ a was one of the two sites that OP@@ C@@ W inspec@@ tors were not able to visi@@ t.
Syria has sub@@ mitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons that has to be approved next month by the OP@@ C@@ W@@ 's executive committe@@ e.
"@@ I sal@@ ute the for@@ titu@@ de and courage you@@ '@@ ve all demonstrated in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organiz@@ ation@@ ," the watch@@ dog@@ 's direc@@ tor@@ -@@ general, Ah@@ met U@@ zum@@ cu@@ , said in com@@ ments released by the OP@@ C@@ W.
Now in its third year, the civil war p@@ its the primarily Sunni Muslim rebels against Ass@@ ad@@ 's government and its security forces, which are st@@ acked with members of his A@@ la@@ wi@@ te sec@@ t, an off@@ sho@@ ot of Shi@@ ite Islam.
In other develop@@ ments, the Ob@@ serv@@ ator@@ y's chief R@@ ami Ab@@ dur@@ rah@@ man said there had been a strong explosion W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day inside an air defense facility in Syri@@ a's coastal province of Lat@@ aki@@ a.
The cause of the b@@ last was not know@@ n, he sa@@ id.
An@@ ger over Bali bomb plo@@ t@@ ter@@ 's sent@@ ence
Sur@@ vi@@ vor@@ s and rel@@ atives of the 20@@ 2 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing have reacted with anger over the sent@@ ence given to the last of the plo@@ t@@ ters to face justice, saying U@@ mar Pat@@ ek should face a fir@@ ing squ@@ ad.
Pat@@ ek@@ , who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of Sou@@ th-@@ East Asi@@ a's most wan@@ ted, was y@@ ester@@ day sent@@ enced to 20 years in j@@ ail for his role in building the explosive de@@ vices used in the bomb@@ ing.
He could be released within 15 years if granted par@@ ol@@ e.
The 4@@ 5-@@ year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two night@@ club@@ s in the popular touri@@ st area of K@@ ut@@ a which left 20@@ 2 people de@@ ad, including 8@@ 8 Australi@@ ans, and in@@ ju@@ red scores more.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terror@@ ism@@ -@@ related char@@ ges, including a wave of bomb@@ ings of chur@@ ches across Indonesia on Christ@@ mas E@@ ve in 2000.
Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors had demanded a life sent@@ ence, although they could have pushed that the man dubbed the "@@ Demo@@ li@@ tion Man@@ " for his reputation as a master bomb@@ -@@ mak@@ er be sent@@ enced to death.
The decision has reig@@ n@@ ited painful memories for Per@@ th mother June Cor@@ te@@ en, who lost her 3@@ 9-@@ year-old t@@ win daugh@@ ters J@@ ane and J@@ enn@@ y in the destruction unleash@@ ed by Pat@@ ek and his co-@@ con@@ spir@@ ators almost a decade ago.
F@@ igh@@ ting back te@@ ar@@ s, she said Pat@@ ek should have been sent@@ enced to death.
I really feel that he should follow in the foot@@ steps of the other gu@@ y@@ s.
"@@ He should be put in front of the fir@@ ing squ@@ ad@@ ," M@@ s Cor@@ teen told A@@ AP@@ .
I have to live every day without seeing more grand@@ children, and my daugh@@ ters.
The S@@ ari Club was le@@ v@@ elled when a massive bomb lo@@ aded into a van par@@ ked outside was det@@ on@@ ated just after 11@@ p@@ m on October 1@@ 2, 2002.
Peter Hu@@ gh@@ es was in P@@ add@@ y's B@@ ar where a suicide bom@@ ber det@@ on@@ ated a back@@ p@@ ack lo@@ aded with explo@@ sives just 20 sec@@ onds ear@@ lier@@ .
He lap@@ sed into a month@@ -@@ long com@@ a in the wake of the bomb@@ ing, and "@@ di@@ ed@@ " three times while on life support.
M@@ r Hu@@ gh@@ es said Pat@@ ek should have shared the same fate as three other members of the Jem@@ a@@ ah Islam@@ i@@ ah terror cell responsible for the car@@ n@@ age - Am@@ ro@@ zi@@ , M@@ uk@@ hl@@ as and I@@ ma@@ m Samu@@ dra - who were exec@@ uted four years ago.
Re@@ ally, this gu@@ y should get the death pen@@ alty before any@@ bod@@ y.
To keep him ali@@ ve, well, there@@ 's no reason to keep him ali@@ ve.
To get 20 years, after killing 20@@ 2 people and inj@@ uring many hund@@ re@@ ds, it@@ 's not much.
Pat@@ ek is the last of the Bali bom@@ bers to face justice.
He had avoided capture for almost a decade but was eventually ap@@ prehen@@ ded in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Ab@@ bott@@ ab@@ ad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the tri@@ al, an F@@ BI ag@@ ent t@@ esti@@ fied that intelligence reports had revealed Pat@@ ek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-@@ establish links between Sou@@ th-@@ East Asian terrorist groups and al-@@ Qaed@@ a.
"@@ He did@@ n't give himself up@@ ," M@@ s Cor@@ teen sa@@ id.
Until just recently, he really did@@ n't feel sor@@ ry for how much gri@@ ef he caused other people.
The ver@@ dict comes ahead of the 10@@ th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will be marked by cerem@@ oni@@ es in Bali and Australi@@ a.
"@@ There will be a lot of te@@ ars this year@@ ," M@@ s Cor@@ teen sa@@ id.
Pat@@ ek may yet appeal his sent@@ ence.
F@@ AA@@ : Air passen@@ gers can now use g@@ ad@@ gets on plan@@ es (@@ but not make cell phone call@@ s)
Air@@ line passen@@ gers will be able to use their electronic de@@ vices g@@ ate-@@ to-@@ g@@ ate to read@@ , work, play gam@@ es, watch movi@@ es and listen to musi@@ c - but not talk on their cell@@ phones - under much-@@ anticipated new guid@@ elines issued Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day by the Federal Avi@@ ation Administ@@ ration.
But passen@@ gers sho@@ uld@@ n't expect changes to happen immedi@@ ately.
How fast the change is implemented will vary by the air@@ line, F@@ A@@ A Administ@@ rat@@ or Michael Hu@@ er@@ ta said at a news confer@@ ence.
Air@@ lines will have to show the F@@ A@@ A how their air@@ plan@@ es meet the new guid@@ elines and that the@@ y@@ '@@ ve up@@ d@@ ating their flight cre@@ w training manu@@ als and rules for st@@ owing de@@ vices to reflect the new guid@@ el@@ ines.
The F@@ A@@ A said it has already received plans from some air@@ lines to expand the use of port@@ able electronic de@@ vices on plan@@ es.
Del@@ ta and J@@ et@@ Blu@@ e were among the air@@ lin@@ ers who have already sub@@ mitted plan@@ s.
"@@ Dep@@ ending on the condition of the plan, we could approve expanded use of electronic de@@ vices very so@@ on@@ ," the F@@ A@@ A said in a stat@@ ement.
Cur@@ r@@ ently, passen@@ gers are required to turn off their smar@@ t@@ ph@@ ones, t@@ able@@ ts and other de@@ vices once a plan@@ e's door clos@@ es.
Th@@ ey@@ '@@ re not supposed to res@@ tar@@ t them until the plan@@ es reach 10,000 fe@@ et and the cap@@ tain gives the go@@ -@@ ahead.
Pas@@ sen@@ gers are supposed to turn their de@@ vices off again as the plane desc@@ ends to land and not res@@ tar@@ t them until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new guid@@ el@@ ines, air@@ lines whose plan@@ es are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passen@@ gers to use the de@@ vices during take@@ off@@ s, land@@ ings and tax@@ i@@ ing, the F@@ A@@ A sa@@ id.
Most new air@@ lin@@ ers and other plan@@ es that have been modified so that passen@@ gers can use Wi@@ fi at higher al@@ titu@@ des are expected to meet the criteri@@ a.
Lau@@ ra G@@ lad@@ ing, president of the Association of Prof@@ ession@@ al F@@ light At@@ ten@@ d@@ ants, welcomed the changes.
"@@ Once the new policy is saf@@ ely implemented - and we@@ '@@ re going to work closely with the car@@ ri@@ er to do that - it will be a win@@ -@@ win@@ ," G@@ lad@@ ing said in a stat@@ ement.
We@@ '@@ re f@@ rank@@ ly ti@@ red of feeling like '@@ hal@@ l monit@@ or@@ s' when it comes to this issue.
But connec@@ ting to the Internet to sur@@ f, exchange em@@ ail@@ s, text or down@@ lo@@ ad data will still be prohi@@ bited below 10,000 fe@@ et, the agency sa@@ id.
Pas@@ sen@@ gers will be told to swit@@ ch their smar@@ t@@ ph@@ ones, t@@ able@@ ts and other de@@ vices to air@@ plane mo@@ de.
So, still no Wor@@ ds With Fri@@ end@@ s, the online S@@ cra@@ b@@ ble-@@ type game that actor Ale@@ c Bal@@ d@@ win was playing on his smar@@ t@@ phone in 2011 when he was famously boo@@ ted off an American Air@@ lines j@@ et for refusing to turn off the de@@ vice while the plane was par@@ ked at the g@@ ate.
And he@@ a@@ vier de@@ vices such as lap@@ t@@ ops will continue to have to be st@@ owed because of concern they might inj@@ ure someone if they go fl@@ ying around the c@@ ab@@ in.
In@@ -@@ flight cell@@ phone calls also will continue to be prohi@@ bit@@ ed.
Regul@@ atory authority over phone calls belong@@ s to the Federal Commun@@ ic@@ ations Commission, not the F@@ AA@@ .
F@@ A@@ A may lift ban on some electronic de@@ vices during take@@ off and landing
Last month, National Transpor@@ tation Saf@@ ety Board Mark Ro@@ senk@@ er, a CB@@ S News national transportation safety exper@@ t, said that cell phones are still considered a risk.
"@@ C@@ ell ph@@ ones, that really is an issue, not just because potentially it could create interference with navig@@ ational devic@@ es, but we do know, according to the F@@ CC@@ , that it could inter@@ fere with cell phone to@@ wers when the@@ y@@ '@@ re in the air@@ ," Ro@@ sen@@ ker sa@@ id.
An industry advis@@ ory committee created by the F@@ A@@ A to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devic@@ es.
Pres@@ sure has been building on the F@@ A@@ A in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Cri@@ tics such as S@@ en. C@@ la@@ ire McC@@ as@@ kill@@ , D-@@ Mo@@ ., con@@ tend there is no vali@@ d safety reason for the prohibi@@ tions.
The restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the de@@ vices has become ubi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous.
Some studies indicate as many as a third of passen@@ gers forget or ignore direc@@ tions to turn off their devic@@ es.
The F@@ A@@ A began restric@@ ting passen@@ ger@@ s' use of electronic de@@ vices in 196@@ 6 in response to reports of interference with navig@@ ation and communications equipment when passen@@ gers began carrying F@@ M radi@@ os, the high-tech g@@ ad@@ gets of their day.
New air@@ lin@@ ers are far more reli@@ ant on electri@@ cal systems than previous generations of air@@ cra@@ ft, but they are also designed and approved by the F@@ A@@ A to be resistant to electronic interfer@@ ence.
Air@@ lines have been offering Wi@@ -@@ F@@ i use at cru@@ is@@ ing al@@ titu@@ des to passen@@ gers for several years.
Plan@@ es modified for Wi@@ -@@ F@@ i systems are also more resistant to interfer@@ ence.
The vast majority of air@@ lin@@ ers should quali@@ fy for greater electronic de@@ vice use under the new guid@@ el@@ ines, Hu@@ er@@ ta sa@@ id.
Toda@@ y's electronic de@@ vices generally em@@ it much lower power radi@@ o trans@@ missions than previous generations of devic@@ es.
E-@@ re@@ a@@ ders, for example, em@@ it only minimal trans@@ missions when turning a pa@@ ge.
But trans@@ missions are stronger when de@@ vices are down@@ lo@@ ading or sending data.
Among those pressing for a relax@@ ation of restrictions on passen@@ ger@@ s' use of the de@@ vices has been Ama@@ zon@@ .@@ com@@ .
In 2011, company officials lo@@ aded an air@@ lin@@ er full of their Kind@@ le e-@@ re@@ a@@ ders and fle@@ w it around to test for problems but found n@@ one.
F@@ A@@ A advis@@ ory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the de@@ vices presents any risk.
D@@ ou@@ gl@@ as K@@ id@@ d of the National Association of Air@@ line Pas@@ sen@@ gers said he believes interference from the de@@ vices is genuine even if the risk is minim@@ al.
Other committee members said there are only an@@ ec@@ do@@ tal reports from pilo@@ ts to support that the de@@ vices can inter@@ fere with aircraft systems, and most of those reports are very ol@@ d.
However, the committee recommended the F@@ A@@ A allow pilo@@ ts to order passen@@ gers to shut off de@@ vices during instrument land@@ ings in low visi@@ bility.
A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common@@ -@@ sense accommod@@ ations for a travel@@ ing public now bri@@ st@@ ling with technology.
"@@ We@@ '@@ re pleas@@ ed the F@@ A@@ A recognizes that an enjo@@ y@@ able passen@@ ger experience is not in@@ compatible with safety and securit@@ y@@ ," said Ro@@ ger D@@ ow, CEO of the U@@ .@@ S. Tra@@ vel Associ@@ ation.
Bir@@ d air@@ lifted to safety from North Sea ri@@ g released back into wild
A bir@@ d air@@ lifted ash@@ ore after being found exhau@@ sted on a North Sea oil ri@@ g has been released back into the wil@@ d.

Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain@@ ?
Business for Britain launched in April with a pledge to bring business together and define what the UK@@ 's wealth and job cre@@ ators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU.
To that end, we commission@@ ed the largest and most comprehensive poll of British business leaders asking them for their though@@ ts on Britain, business and the EU.
You@@ Go@@ v poll@@ ed over 1,000 business leaders, broadly representative of Britain@@ 's business si@@ z@@ es, sectors and regions.
The conclusions of the poll will come as a surprise to man@@ y.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are moder@@ nis@@ ing and growing while the EU states stag@@ nat@@ e.
They want to see the Government priori@@ ti@@ se new trading links with the likes of China, India and Brazil, rather than getting bo@@ gged down in the long and ar@@ du@@ ous process of reforming the EU's ar@@ can@@ e institutions.
When asked their views on specific policy areas - ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders thought that control of these key compet@@ ences should be returned to West@@ min@@ ster.
There was general discontent with the Sing@@ le Mark@@ et, with businesses saying that the costs of Brussels regulation now out@@ weigh@@ ed the benefits of being part of Europe's trading area - even 40 per cent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-@@ European of companies, agre@@ ed.
Finally, and most tell@@ ingly of all, our poll of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see Britain pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the EU that is based on trade, not politics.
This find@@ ing, which was reflected across the si@@ zes and major business groups, shows that business is pushing for a "@@ meaningful change@@ " that brings powers back to the UK@@ .
The stakes are high - achieving treaty change and a better deal for Britain sees a 16 per cent swing towards voting to stay in the EU in a referend@@ um.
The Prime Minister should be in no doub@@ t: this poll shows that British business backs his plan for renegoti@@ ating the terms of Britain@@ 's membership of the EU.
It also shows that business expects that renegoti@@ ation to make a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK@@ .
A better deal for British business is possible, and increasingly necessary as the eurozone emb@@ ark@@ s on the road to closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our poll show@@ , for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussel@@ s" regulatory approach.
Gazpro@@ m@@ 's Alex@@ ei M@@ iller says pipeline in Bulg@@ aria starts new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stre@@ am gas pipeline in Bulg@@ aria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, Gazpro@@ m@@ 's chief sa@@ id.
"@@ A land@@ mark event has taken place toda@@ y: Con@@ struc@@ tion started on the Bulg@@ arian sec@@ tion of the South Stre@@ am gas pipel@@ ine, the most large-scale and important project in Europe@@ ," Gazprom Chairman Alex@@ ei M@@ iller said in a statement Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day.
This project is a key element of energy security of the whole European continent.
South Stre@@ am is meant to add diversity to Russia's export ro@@ utes through Europe.
A contrac@@ tual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, which ho@@ sts most of Russia's gas for Europe, adds a lay@@ er of risk to conventional rout@@ es, officials sa@@ y.
M@@ iller said the direct connection to Bulgari@@ a, a member of the European Union, means geopolitical risks associated with transi@@ t countries are eliminated "@@ for@@ ever@@ ."
Bulg@@ arian consumers will receive gas from South Stre@@ am at a dis@@ counted rate once the entire project starts operating in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other down@@ stream countries by year@@ 's end.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.@@ 2 trillion c@@ ub@@ ic fe@@ et of natural g@@ as.

The extent to which German commercial proper@@ ties are sought after is evident in the transaction volum@@ es, said Ul@@ brich@@ .
In the first three quarters of this year, there was an increase of 3@@ 1% compared to the same period the year before.
In Great Britain, growth stands at just 6@@ %, and in France at 19@@ %.

Two Y@@ M@@ C@@ A employees charged with sex offen@@ ces before alleg@@ ations against J@@ on@@ athan L@@ or@@ d, Royal Commission hear@@ s
Two Y@@ M@@ C@@ A N@@ S@@ W employees had been charged with child sex offen@@ ces before alleg@@ ations were raised against Car@@ ing@@ b@@ ah child care worker J@@ on@@ athan Lord in 2011, the child sexual abuse Royal Commission has hear@@ d.
But in its opening statement to the Commission it said it had "@@ never dealt with an inci@@ dent of child sexual assault within its organis@@ ation@@ ," the Commission was tol@@ d.
Chief executive offic@@ er Ph@@ illi@@ p H@@ are was asked about one case where a Y@@ M@@ C@@ A employe@@ e was charged child por@@ nograph@@ y off@@ ences, and another when a gy@@ m instruc@@ tor at the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A Car@@ ing@@ b@@ ah H@@ all was convic@@ ted of child sexual offen@@ ces against children in his care in 199@@ 1.
M@@ r H@@ are told G@@ ail Fur@@ ness, coun@@ sel assist@@ ing the Commission, he knew about the first case but did not know about the second one.
He conc@@ eded the Y@@ M@@ CA@@ 's opening statement to the commission was also in@@ accurate in claiming "@@ there have been external audi@@ ts of the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A that have reco@@ g@@ nis@@ ed the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A as being at the foref@@ ront of child safet@@ y@@ ."
Evi@@ dence before the commission is that Y@@ M@@ C@@ A was noti@@ fied that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in a Department of Education and Com@@ m@@ unities quality audi@@ t in August this year.
M@@ r Har@@ e, who started with the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A when he was 2@@ 1, conc@@ eded management "@@ from my@@ self down@@ " failed by recru@@ iting Lord and failed to make sure staff were clear about their obligations to report child safe policy bre@@ ach@@ es.
Ear@@ lier this year Lord was convic@@ ted for sexual offen@@ ces against 12 boys during the two years he worked at the Y@@ M@@ CA@@ .
He was jail@@ ed for a minimum of six years.
But M@@ r H@@ are rejected the sugges@@ tion the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting L@@ ord@@ 's bre@@ ach@@ es of child safet@@ y.
St@@ af@@ f gave evidence they observed bre@@ ach@@ es including Lord being alone with children, bab@@ ysi@@ tting them priv@@ ately, having them sit on his lap@@ , saying he lo@@ ved one and letting them play with his mobile ph@@ one.
Dan@@ iel@@ le O@@ ck@@ well, who was supervis@@ ed by Lord and asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavi@@ our@@ , t@@ esti@@ fied she found the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A Car@@ ing@@ b@@ ah children@@ 's services manager Jacqu@@ i Bar@@ n@@ at who supervis@@ ed Lord "@@ very intimid@@ ating and hard to approach a lot of the time@@ ."
The CEO said he did not accept staff@@ 's evidence that they were un@@ comfortable with reporting up@@ wards to their manag@@ ers.
Rather, he said, their friend@@ ships with Lord clou@@ ded their jud@@ gements about reporting him.
M@@ r H@@ are said he had provided his view to the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A N@@ S@@ W board that the lesson for the organisation from the "@@ J@@ on@@ athan Lord inci@@ dent@@ " was "@@ not about report@@ ing@@ " by staff@@ , and the board agreed with him.
M@@ r H@@ are said the decision to get staff to sign confi@@ denti@@ ality agreements soon after the alleg@@ ations emerged was made by Y@@ M@@ C@@ A general manager of children@@ 's services Li@@ am Wh@@ it@@ le@@ y.
He said it was intended to avoid contam@@ ination of evidence but was "@@ over@@ ze@@ al@@ ous@@ " and poorly execu@@ ted.
Y@@ M@@ C@@ A N@@ S@@ W was not a child safe organisation at the time J@@ on@@ athan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011, child sex abuse expert Professor Ste@@ phen Sm@@ all@@ b@@ one of Gri@@ ff@@ ith University told the commission@@ .

And T@@ off@@ ee received top marks for his appearance and person@@ ality.
F@@ ent@@ on was given T@@ off@@ ee as a third birth@@ day present last March and has practi@@ sed with the Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y every day sin@@ ce.
His mother Don@@ n@@ a, 3@@ 0, sa@@ id@@ : "@@ F@@ ent@@ on and T@@ off@@ ee are a great double ac@@ t@@ ."
They were up against all com@@ ers but the two of them wal@@ ked off with the gold c@@ up and ro@@ set@@ te.
It was only the second time he had compet@@ ed with T@@ off@@ ee and we were all ec@@ st@@ atic when he w@@ on.
Com@@ ple@@ te stran@@ gers in the ar@@ ena all thought he was so phenomen@@ al they wanted pho@@ tos taken with him.
The young@@ ster, from the village of N@@ ant@@ y@@ glo@@ , near E@@ b@@ b@@ w V@@ ale, South Wal@@ es, is following in the foot@@ steps of his a@@ unt Sharon H@@ ow@@ ell@@ s, who has been showing hor@@ ses for more than 10 years.
Mr@@ s H@@ ow@@ ells sa@@ id@@ : "@@ The whole place was electric and everybody was che@@ ering and cl@@ app@@ ing@@ ."
He was running on s@@ and down the full leng@@ th of the ar@@ ena and even though he looked so tiny he did a mar@@ vel@@ lo@@ us job.
F@@ ent@@ on is animal mad - he lo@@ ves hor@@ ses, trac@@ tors and far@@ ms and has got two chick@@ ens which he looks af@@ ter.
The way he has started he@@ '@@ ll be at the Hor@@ se of the Year show before long - and I@@ '@@ m sure he@@ '@@ ll do well.
A spo@@ kes@@ man for the annual hor@@ se show sa@@ id@@ : "@@ F@@ ent@@ on is only three but he knows how to handle his pon@@ y@@ ."
They are a great team together.
The judges marked F@@ ent@@ on and T@@ off@@ ee on how well they were turned out and the way they presented in the show r@@ ing.
They look for good team@@ work between the pon@@ y and the hand@@ ler - F@@ ent@@ on and T@@ off@@ ee were the best in the r@@ ing.
I@@ '@@ m sure F@@ ent@@ on was helped by his cu@@ te clo@@ th@@ es, he really looked the part.
China ple@@ a paper '@@ to be overhau@@ led@@ '
A Chinese newspaper that made a front-@@ page appeal for the release of a repor@@ ter accused of def@@ am@@ ation is to be overhau@@ led, a press regul@@ ator say@@ s.
The Guang@@ zh@@ ou@@ -based New Ex@@ press made a rare public ple@@ a for the release of journalist Chen Y@@ ong@@ zh@@ ou@@ .
But M@@ r Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had taken bri@@ bes to fabri@@ c@@ ate stories about a part state-owned compan@@ y.
Now the New Ex@@ press is to under@@ go "@@ full rec@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation@@ ," the regul@@ ator sa@@ id.
The "@@ rec@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation@@ " order came from the Guang@@ d@@ ong Administration of Pres@@ s and Pub@@ lic@@ ation, Radi@@ o, Film and Tel@@ evi@@ sion.
A pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary investigation showed that Y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g E@@ ven@@ ing News Gro@@ up@@ 's New Ex@@ press had published several un@@ true reports about listed company Zo@@ om@@ li@@ on in the period of September 2012 to August 2013.
"@@ New Ex@@ pres@@ s@@ 's edi@@ tori@@ al management was disorder@@ ed@@ ," the regul@@ ator said in a stat@@ ement.
It said it had decided to "@@ impose an administrative pen@@ alty on Chen Y@@ ong@@ z@@ hou by re@@ vo@@ king his repor@@ ter@@ 's lic@@ en@@ se@@ ."
It had also "@@ instruc@@ ted Y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g E@@ ven@@ ing News Group to undertake a complete rec@@ ti@@ fication of New Ex@@ press, and recommended they investig@@ ate the relevant responsible person@@ s at New Ex@@ press and immediately revis@@ e New Ex@@ pres@@ s@@ 's leadership team@@ ."
M@@ r Chen wrote several ar@@ ticles for the New Ex@@ press alleg@@ ing financial ir@@ regul@@ arities at a construc@@ tion-@@ equipment company called Zo@@ om@@ li@@ on.
After he was detain@@ ed, his newspaper published two front-@@ page appeals for his releas@@ e, saying it backed his journ@@ alism.
But M@@ r Chen then appeared on state television ad@@ mitting he had published false stories for money.
"@@ In this case I@@ '@@ ve caused dam@@ ages to Zo@@ om@@ li@@ on and also the whole news media industry and its ability to earn the public@@ 's tru@@ st@@ ," he told state broadcast@@ er CC@@ T@@ V@@ .
I did this mainly because I h@@ ank@@ ered after money and fam@@ e.
I@@ '@@ ve re@@ alis@@ ed my wrong@@ do@@ ing.
Following M@@ r Chen@@ 's ap@@ ology, New Ex@@ press issued a front-@@ page ap@@ ology, saying it had failed to properly check his report@@ s.
Several high-@@ profile suspec@@ ts have made tel@@ ev@@ ised conf@@ essions rec@@ ently.
Exper@@ ts say conf@@ essions are still routinely co@@ erc@@ ed, despite a change in the law earlier this year bann@@ ing the authorities from forcing anyone to in@@ crimin@@ ate themselves.
US-@@ Mexico drug tun@@ nel with its own rail@@ way found
One of the most sophisticated drug smugg@@ ling tun@@ n@@ els between the USA and Mexico has been found@@ , complete with its own ligh@@ ting, ven@@ til@@ ation and electric ra@@ il systems.
US authorities described the four fo@@ ot by three fo@@ ot tun@@ nel as one of the most sophisticated secret pass@@ ages they have ever discover@@ ed.
The tun@@ n@@ el, which zig@@ z@@ ag@@ s the leng@@ th of nearly six football pit@@ ch@@ es, links war@@ eh@@ ous@@ es near Ti@@ ju@@ ana, Mexico and San Di@@ e@@ go, USA.
The area is filled with non@@ descri@@ pt war@@ eh@@ ous@@ es, making it easier to conc@@ e@@ al tru@@ cks being lo@@ aded with drug@@ s.
The tun@@ nel was shut down before any drugs made it through un@@ detec@@ ted, authorities sa@@ id.
Auth@@ orities seized eigh@@ t-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half tons of mari@@ ju@@ ana and 3@@ 27 po@@ unds of coc@@ ain@@ e in connection with the tun@@ n@@ el@@ 's discover@@ y, according to court record@@ s.
Three men who authorities say worked as drivers were charged with poss@@ ession of mari@@ ju@@ ana and coc@@ ain@@ e with intent to distribu@@ te.
They face prison sent@@ ences between 10 years and life imprison@@ ment if convic@@ ted.
In No@@ gal@@ es, Ari@@ zon@@ a, smugg@@ lers tap into vast underground dra@@ in@@ age can@@ als.
The tun@@ nel is the eigh@@ th major passage discovered in San Di@@ eg@@ o since 2006.
Some of the largest tun@@ n@@ els have been discovered after central Mexico@@ 's mari@@ ju@@ ana har@@ v@@ est in October, which presents drug car@@ tels with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a roughly 700@@ -@@ y@@ ard passage equipped with ra@@ il tra@@ cks that extended from the kit@@ chen of a Ti@@ ju@@ ana home to two San Di@@ eg@@ o war@@ eh@@ ous@@ es.
Or@@ land@@ o Blo@@ om and M@@ ir@@ anda Ker@@ r still love each other
Ac@@ tors Or@@ land@@ o Blo@@ om and Mo@@ del M@@ ir@@ anda Ker@@ r want to go their separate ways.
However, in an inter@@ view, Blo@@ om has said that he and Ker@@ r still love each other.
M@@ ir@@ anda Ker@@ r and Or@@ land@@ o Blo@@ om are parents to two-@@ year-old Fl@@ yn@@ n.
Ac@@ tor Or@@ land@@ o Blo@@ om announced his separation from his wi@@ fe, super@@ model M@@ ir@@ anda Ker@@ r.
In an inter@@ view with US journalist K@@ ati@@ e Cou@@ ri@@ c, which is to be broad@@ cast on Fri@@ day (@@ local time@@ ), Blo@@ om said, "@@ sometimes life does@@ n't go exactly as we plan or hope for@@ ".
He and Ker@@ r still love each other, emphasi@@ sed the 3@@ 6-@@ year-@@ ol@@ d.
"@@ We@@ '@@ re going to support one another and love each other as parents to Fl@@ yn@@ n@@ ".
Ker@@ r and Blo@@ om have been married since 2010. Their son Fl@@ yn@@ n was born in 2011.
According to dic@@ tion@@ aries, v@@ eg@@ anism is a sub-@@ categ@@ ory of ve@@ get@@ ari@@ an@@ ism, yet the two do differ consider@@ ably.
For while ve@@ get@@ ari@@ ans allow themselves to consume cre@@ am tar@@ ts, ice cre@@ am or a strong E@@ dam@@ , these in@@ dul@@ gen@@ ces are off the men@@ u for v@@ eg@@ ans.
Mil@@ k, che@@ ese, eg@@ g - alongside avoiding me@@ at and fis@@ h, v@@ eg@@ ans refra@@ in from e@@ ating all products of animal origin - even hon@@ ey is not per@@ mit@@ ted.
You might ask what is left, however, upon closer inspec@@ tion the world of v@@ eg@@ an nutrition is character@@ ised by great resourc@@ eful@@ ness.
"@@ Spre@@ ads are very popular@@ ," explained U@@ te H@@ enk@@ el@@ mann the ow@@ ner of the local health food stor@@ e, which provides a host of special products for v@@ eg@@ ans.
Re@@ ub@@ en Proc@@ tor also likes to visit the store on "@@ Dom@@ gas@@ se@@ ".
The New Zeal@@ ander has been v@@ eg@@ an for 13 years, and in Lam@@ per@@ thei@@ m he can find (@@ al@@ most@@ ) everything that he needs to get b@@ y. "@@ In 1997 I adjusted my di@@ et and became a ve@@ get@@ ari@@ an@@ ".
At the turn of the millenni@@ um I took the next step and became v@@ eg@@ an.
"@@ However, it was@@ n't just the di@@ et that convinced me, but also my choice of sho@@ es@@ ," said Proc@@ tor, who pre@@ fers artificial lea@@ ther over normal lea@@ ther.
He re@@ alis@@ ed that you can also overcome all other daily concerns without animal products.
First and foremost, being v@@ eg@@ an is a matter of eth@@ ics.
"@@ I don't want animals to have to die for me@@ ," said Proc@@ tor, expres@@ sing the ma@@ x@@ im of v@@ eg@@ ans, which applies to all their consumer behavi@@ our@@ .
Rather than missing bur@@ ger@@ s, scra@@ m@@ bled eg@@ gs or g@@ um@@ m@@ i bear@@ s, the v@@ eg@@ an has quickly discovered entirely new products that really inspire him.
"@@ It is a double bon@@ us@@ ," says Proc@@ tor now, "@@ in actual fact being v@@ eg@@ an is not about doing with@@ out, it@@ 's not about asc@@ e@@ tic@@ ism, but rather it is an enh@@ anc@@ ement@@ ". Regar@@ ding the assumption that when you conver@@ t your di@@ et you are reducing your choice of me@@ al op@@ tions, Proc@@ tor puts this down to force of hab@@ it.
And it is precisely this condi@@ tioning that results in many a well-@@ inten@@ tioned attempt fail@@ ing.
"@@ The temptation factor is a decisive factor in causing many to quickly give up, similar to with smo@@ k@@ ing@@ ," says Proc@@ tor, providing a comparis@@ on.
And he argu@@ es: "@@ C@@ ertain f@@ la@@ vo@@ urs are not linked to animal produc@@ e@@ ".
O@@ ften it is the her@@ bs or the type of prepar@@ ation that provide the f@@ la@@ vo@@ ur@@ .
"@@ You can, however, create the same effect in other way@@ s@@ ," explains the v@@ eg@@ an.
For example, when atten@@ ding a bar@@ be@@ c@@ ue party, Proc@@ tor brings au@@ berg@@ ines, mus@@ h@@ ro@@ oms and also a few v@@ eg@@ an s@@ aus@@ ages.
He ensures a balanc@@ ed, vari@@ ed di@@ et, whereby everything should also have a good hear@@ ty f@@ la@@ vo@@ ur@@ .
Of course you want to have something with a bit of bit@@ e, that is fair enough.
"@@ It should be ta@@ st@@ y, but this does@@ n't necessarily mean anim@@ al-@@ based fo@@ od@@ ," said Proc@@ tor.
He has not suffered any damage to his health or e@@ ating dis@@ orders - another wi@@ de-@@ spread assump@@ tion.
Con@@ ver@@ ting has had a positive effect for me.
I do not consume any foreign ch@@ ol@@ ester@@ ol and have increased my vit@@ amin in@@ tak@@ e.
There are top ath@@ le@@ tes who also have an exclusively v@@ eg@@ an di@@ et.
"@@ My blood values are excellent - I have my@@ self check@@ ed on a regular basi@@ s@@ ," revealed Proc@@ tor.
Many critics of v@@ eg@@ anism war@@ n in particular of the lack of vit@@ amin B@@ 12.
"@@ Because animals are fed on fo@@ d@@ der instead of gra@@ z@@ ing, it is dubious whether the vit@@ amin B@@ 12 content in me@@ at sold in free@@ z@@ ers is actually high@@ ," comment@@ ed Proc@@ tor.
For v@@ eg@@ ans there is also the option of taking the co-@@ enz@@ y@@ me in the form of t@@ able@@ ts.
"@@ My B@@ 12 values are fin@@ e@@ ," he expla@@ in@@ ed.
Proc@@ tor does not have to travel far to buy fo@@ od.
There are basic fo@@ od@@ stu@@ ffs available everywhere, and every super@@ market now has so@@ ya mil@@ k and other products.
I can find everything I need lo@@ cally.
I only purchase special items now and again.
"@@ Many people over@@ look the fact that even though read@@ y-@@ made v@@ eg@@ an products are expensive, it is well-@@ known that this is also the case for "@@ normal@@ " read@@ y-@@ made products.
In any case, the prepar@@ ation of v@@ eg@@ an dish@@ es is much cheaper and less time consuming than commonly assum@@ ed.
"@@ In home co@@ ok@@ ing, there is much to be discovered - with a few minor t@@ weak@@ s you can achieve good, if not sometimes better resul@@ ts@@ ," said Proc@@ tor.
Margar@@ ine in place of but@@ ter, a little more b@@ aking po@@ w@@ der and bi@@ car@@ bon@@ ate of so@@ da in place of eg@@ g - Proc@@ tor has even managed to aston@@ ish his in-@@ laws with his v@@ eg@@ an che@@ ese c@@ ak@@ es.
The v@@ eg@@ an adds new spi@@ ce to family parties.
When you co@@ ok together there is a certain dynamic - co@@ oking takes on new value.
"@@ The situations that may arise are as vari@@ ed as the people themsel@@ ves@@ ," said Proc@@ tor.
Of course he has already met with sc@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism.
Do you not like my food any mor@@ e?
"@@ Should I feel bad now because I drin@@ k mil@@ k@@ ?" - as a v@@ eg@@ an you have to be tac@@ tful in such matters.
"@@ I do not dis@@ approve of people, I am part of this societ@@ y@@ ," said Proc@@ tor, explaining that he was not choosing a life of isol@@ ation.
And on closer observ@@ ation, the everyday world does not appear quite so '@@ un-@@ v@@ eg@@ an@@ ' - and v@@ eg@@ ans are not quite as limited in their everyday lives as is commonly assum@@ ed.
Fast food is also per@@ mit@@ ted.
Ch@@ ip@@ s are available every@@ where@@ !
"@@ Many don@@ er keb@@ ab houses offer fal@@ af@@ el, or even ve@@ get@@ arian Y@@ uf@@ ka@@ ," says Proc@@ tor.
In a p@@ iz@@ z@@ eri@@ a he avo@@ ids pa@@ sta dish@@ es or just orders a p@@ iz@@ za without che@@ ese, all just a question of hab@@ it.
Restau@@ rants are slowly adap@@ ting to th@@ ings.
"@@ When I began e@@ ating a v@@ eg@@ an di@@ et 13 years ago, things were even more difficul@@ t@@ ," says the New Zeal@@ ander@@ , and he points out@@ : "@@ You have to talk with people, make them awar@@ e@@ ".
"@@ If enough requ@@ ests are made, they will perhaps be inclined to expand their men@@ us@@ ," he hop@@ es.
There are v@@ eg@@ an restau@@ rants opening up, such as the Kom@@ bÃ¼@@ se in Mann@@ hei@@ m or C@@ af@@ Ã© Vo@@ gel@@ frei@@ .
Proc@@ tor hopes that other restau@@ rants will also have at least one v@@ eg@@ an dish on the men@@ u.
Es@@ senti@@ ally, v@@ eg@@ an dish@@ es are for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, they are the exact opposite of exclu@@ sive.
"@@ Me@@ at dish@@ es, on the other hand, are exclu@@ sive, in the tru@@ est sense of the wor@@ d, as they rule others out@@ ," assess@@ ed Proc@@ tor.
"@@ If you want to avoid food scand@@ als, v@@ eg@@ anism is a safe way to rule out the majority of scandals from the outs@@ et@@ ," says Proc@@ tor.
However, purchasing v@@ eg@@ an products can be difficult to start with@@ .
O@@ In@@ ce you come to understand that pe@@ an@@ ut@@ s, in particular, may also contain animal addi@@ tives as a c@@ olo@@ ur@@ ant, people seem to quickly lose courage when following a code of ethics with so many hur@@ d@@ les and pit@@ fall@@ s.
There@@ fore, for this reason and others, Re@@ ub@@ en Proc@@ tor and L@@ ars Thom@@ sen have written a book@@ . "@@ V@@ eg@@ an@@ is@@ sim@@ o - Ti@@ erische In@@ hal@@ ts@@ stoffe und ihre Altern@@ ati@@ ven@@ " (@@ V@@ eg@@ an@@ is@@ sim@@ o - Ani@@ mal In@@ gre@@ di@@ ents and their Altern@@ ativ@@ es) explains the many ingredi@@ ents hidden in both fo@@ od@@ stu@@ ffs and clean@@ ing ag@@ ents.
"@@ You gradually develop an internal sc@@ ann@@ er and you know which symbol@@ s and lo@@ go@@ s you have to look out for@@ ". Proc@@ tor has learned that "@@ it is sometimes better too take small steps rather than to stand still or stum@@ ble@@ ".
V@@ eg@@ anism is an important moral compas@@ s, which has an effect on your consci@@ ous@@ ness.
Perhaps he won@@ 't manage to help you break old habits al@@ together, but at least he man@@ ages to teach consumers to critically question their hab@@ its.
Sto@@ ck exchange oper@@ ator Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X keeps its customers on tent@@ erho@@ ok@@ s.
Tra@@ ding at the Nas@@ da@@ q Op@@ tions Market was interrup@@ ted on Fri@@ day after@@ no@@ on, German time.
In an announc@@ ement, the oper@@ ator cited technical problems as the reas@@ on.
On the other el@@ even options markets, including two also oper@@ ated by Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X@@ , business continued as norm@@ al.
The most recent inci@@ dent is the latest in a series of both small and large break@@ downs suffered by the stock exchange oper@@ ator@@ .
As recently as last Tu@@ es@@ day, the Nas@@ da@@ q indi@@ ces were not calculated for one hour due to data transfer error@@ s.
In August of this year there were two break@@ downs in a single week@@ .
First of all, US investment bank Goldman Sachs sent large quanti@@ ties of incor@@ rec@@ t purchase orders to the options markets due to technical problems.
As a result, the stock exchange oper@@ ators required almost an entire day to look through and del@@ ete the order@@ s.
Two days later, half of all stock dealing in the USA came to a stand@@ still for several hour@@ s, due to a computer failure in the Nas@@ da@@ q ex@@ change.
Furthermore, last year the li@@ sting of Facebook on the stock exchange caused quite a fur@@ or@@ e.
The Nas@@ da@@ q systems could not cope with the flood of purchase and sales order@@ s, the Exchange Super@@ vis@@ ory Authority established at a later dat@@ e, imposing a record pen@@ alty of 10 million dollars on the compan@@ y.
Kon@@ stanz@@ : Cy@@ c@@ list kno@@ cks over 6@@ 3-@@ year-old man
According to the poli@@ ce, the accident occurred on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day ev@@ ening at around 10@@ :@@ 00 p@@ .@@ m@@ ., when a 2@@ 6-@@ year-old man was cy@@ cling illeg@@ ally, on the left foot@@ path of the Bah@@ n@@ ho@@ f@@ platz in the direction of Markt@@ stÃ¤@@ t@@ te, on a la@@ dies bi@@ cy@@ cle.
According to poli@@ ce, when a 6@@ 3-@@ year-old man suddenly stepped out of a pu@@ b onto the foot@@ pa@@ th, the cyc@@ list was unable to bra@@ ke in time.
During the subsequent col@@ li@@ sion, the ped@@ est@@ ri@@ an was thrown against the wall of the build@@ ing, and then fell onto the ground, suffering a lac@@ er@@ ation to the head that measured around 15 cen@@ tim@@ et@@ res in leng@@ th.

British police serve Ass@@ ange with ex@@ tradition notice
B@@ ti@@ tish police served an ex@@ tradition notice today on WikiLe@@ aks founder Juli@@ an Ass@@ an@@ ge, who has taken refu@@ ge in Ecuad@@ or@@ 's emb@@ ass@@ y in London and requ@@ est@@ ed asyl@@ um.
Scotland Y@@ ard said they had served a "@@ surrender notic@@ e" on the 40-@@ year-old Australian requiring him to appear at a police st@@ ation, adding that failure to do so would make him further li@@ able to arres@@ t.
Ass@@ ange faces ex@@ tradition to Sweden over sex crime alleg@@ ations, having exhau@@ sted his options under British law when the Supreme Court over@@ turned his appeal against ex@@ tradition earlier this month.
F@@ ear@@ ing Stock@@ hol@@ m would pass him on to the US, he sought refu@@ ge at Ecuad@@ or@@ 's emb@@ ass@@ y in London on June 19@@ , asking the South American country for political asyl@@ um.
Scotland Y@@ ard has "@@ served a surrender notice upon a 40-@@ year-old man that requires him to attend a police station at date and time of our choo@@ sing@@ ," a spo@@ kes@@ man sa@@ id.
He remains in bre@@ ach of his bail conditions.
The emb@@ ass@@ y declined to com@@ ment on the serving of the police notic@@ e.
Ass@@ ange fears he will be ex@@ tradi@@ ted from Sweden to the United States to face possible es@@ pi@@ on@@ age char@@ ges, after releas@@ ing more than 2@@ 50,000 US diplomatic c@@ ables on the WikiLe@@ aks anti-@@ sec@@ rec@@ y we@@ b@@ si@@ te.
D@@ ri@@ ver spe@@ eding at 1@@ 30@@ mp@@ h with hot drin@@ k between leg@@ s fin@@ ed Â£@@ 1,000
A mo@@ tor@@ ist has been fin@@ ed Â£@@ 1,000 for driving at up to 1@@ 30@@ mp@@ h (@@ 2@@ 10@@ k@@ m@@ /@@ h@@ ) with a hot drin@@ k balanced between his leg@@ s.

When police stopped him they discovered the take@@ away drin@@ k between his leg@@ s.
At Col@@ chest@@ er Ma@@ gi@@ strat@@ es' Court Ho@@ wie admitted a charge of driving without due care and attention.
S@@ even points added to his lic@@ ence resulted in him receiving a six-@@ month driving b@@ an.

Tax on foreign property owners to burst London@@ 's bubble
The Treasury have provi@@ sion@@ ally cost@@ ed out the C@@ G@@ T measure but are awa@@ iting a final decision from M@@ r Os@@ bor@@ ne, who, in the 2012 Bud@@ ge@@ t, introduced a 7% rate of stam@@ p duty for homes cost@@ ing more than Â£@@ 2@@ m and annual charges for buyers who choose to hold homes in a company rather than as individuals.
Al@@ ready the stam@@ p duty take for residential property in the bor@@ ough@@ s of West@@ min@@ ster and K@@ ens@@ ing@@ ton & Ch@@ else@@ a, which stood at Â£@@ 70@@ 8 million in the 201@@ 2@@ /@@ 13 tax year, exceeds the combined total for Northern Ireland, Wal@@ es, Scot@@ land, the North East, North West and Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and the Hum@@ ber put together.
M@@ r Co@@ ok sa@@ id@@ : "@@ Following increases in stam@@ p duty of high value homes and the introduction of associated anti-@@ avoid@@ ance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under-@@ tax@@ ed ir@@ respective of the effect of the out-@@ dated coun@@ cil tax system@@ ."
"@@ But this move could make some foreign investors re@@ tic@@ ent to buy property in London or current owners reluctant to sell@@ ," he ad@@ ded.
Prime property - the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in the afflu@@ ent sou@@ th-@@ west London bel@@ t, which stret@@ ches from F@@ ul@@ ham to W@@ im@@ ble@@ d@@ on, has increased by a record 1@@ 1.@@ 8% over the past year.
Pri@@ ces in central London continued to show steady year-@@ on-@@ year growth of 5.@@ 6% but were over@@ shadow@@ ed by a bur@@ ge@@ oning "@@ domestic market@@ " with the cit@@ y's south wes@@ t, north (@@ 7.@@ 4@@ %) and east (@@ 6.@@ 5@@ %) all experiencing an up@@ ti@@ ck, according to research from S@@ av@@ ill@@ s.
Scienti@@ sts have shed more light on how the movements of a dog@@ 's tail are linked to its mo@@ od.
Ear@@ lier research had revealed that happy do@@ gs wa@@ g their tail@@ s more to the right (@@ from the dog@@ 's point of view@@ ), while nerv@@ ous do@@ gs have a lef@@ t-@@ dominated s@@ wish@@ .
But now scientists say that fellow can@@ ines can spo@@ t and respond to these sub@@ tle tail differ@@ ences.
Pro@@ f Georgi@@ o V@@ all@@ or@@ tig@@ ar@@ a, a neuro@@ scientist from the University of T@@ rent@@ o, sa@@ id@@ : "@@ It is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimul@@ i that invo@@ kes positive or negative emo@@ tions@@ ."
Here we attempted to look at it in other speci@@ es.
He added that just as in hum@@ ans, for do@@ gs the right side of the brain was responsible for lef@@ t-@@ handed movement and vice vers@@ a, and the two h@@ emis@@ pher@@ es played different roles in emo@@ tions.
To find out more about how do@@ gs react to the lo@@ p@@ -@@ si@@ ded tail wag@@ s of other do@@ gs, the researchers monit@@ ored the animals as they watched fil@@ ms of other dog@@ s.
They measured the pet@@ s' heart rates and analy@@ sed their behavi@@ our@@ .
It will probably not be long before we understand why their tail@@ s sometimes go one way, sometimes the other
Pro@@ f V@@ all@@ or@@ tig@@ ara sa@@ id@@ : "@@ We presented do@@ gs with movi@@ es of do@@ gs - either a natu@@ rali@@ stic version or a sil@@ h@@ ou@@ ette to get rid of any other con@@ founding issues, and we could doc@@ tor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or righ@@ t@@ ."
When the animals saw an otherwise expres@@ sion@@ less dog move its tail to the right (@@ from the tail@@ -@@ wag@@ ging dog@@ 's point of view@@ ), they st@@ ayed perfectly relax@@ ed.
But when they spot@@ ted a tail ve@@ er pre@@ dominan@@ tly to the left (@@ again from the tail@@ -@@ s@@ wish@@ ing dog@@ 's point of view@@ ), their heart rates picked up and they looked anxi@@ ous.
Pro@@ f V@@ all@@ or@@ tig@@ ara said he did@@ n't think that the do@@ gs were inten@@ tionally communic@@ ating with each other through these movem@@ ents.
Instead, he believes that they do@@ gs have learned from experience what moves they should and sho@@ uld@@ n't feel worried about.
He sa@@ id@@ : "@@ If you have several meetings with other do@@ gs, and frequently their tail wag@@ ging one way is associated with a more friendly behavi@@ our@@ , and the right side is producing a less friendly behavi@@ our@@ , you respond on the basis of that experienc@@ e@@ ."
The researchers say the findings could give owner@@ s, v@@ ets and train@@ ers a better insi@@ ght into their anim@@ al@@ 's emo@@ tions.
Do@@ g behavi@@ our expert John Bra@@ d@@ sh@@ aw@@ , a visi@@ ting fellow at the University of Bri@@ stol@@ 's school of veter@@ inary science, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to can@@ ines.
Last year a team from the University of L@@ inc@@ ol@@ n found that do@@ gs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy do@@ g.
And in another research paper from the University of Vic@@ tori@@ a in Canada, he sa@@ id@@ : "@@ Do@@ gs were more likely to approach a ro@@ bot dog when its '@@ tail@@ ' was made to wa@@ g left rather than right, rather than becoming anxi@@ ous - the opposite way around to the Italian stud@@ y@@ ."
He said the differences could be because the do@@ gs in the different studies were not fully interpre@@ ting the animals in the fil@@ ms or robo@@ -@@ do@@ gs as can@@ ines.
A study of how do@@ gs responded to real do@@ gs could help, he expla@@ in@@ ed.
"@@ While there is considerable evidence from many different m@@ am@@ mals that the two sides of the brain are used for different purpos@@ es, much of the de@@ tail still has to be ham@@ mer@@ ed out - and do@@ gs are no excep@@ tion@@ ," he sa@@ id.
However, given the ease with which their behavi@@ our can be recor@@ ded, it will probably not be long before we understand why their tail@@ s sometimes go one way, sometimes the other.

Pope Francis to name first car@@ din@@ als in February
Pope Francis will create new car@@ din@@ als of the Catholic Church for his first time on February 2@@ 2, the Vati@@ can announced Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day.
Car@@ din@@ als are the high@@ est-@@ ranking cl@@ erg@@ y in the Catholic Church below the pop@@ e, and the@@ y@@ '@@ re the ones who elect pop@@ es, so Francis will be appointing his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his success@@ or.
There are now 20@@ 1 car@@ din@@ als.
However, once a car@@ din@@ al reaches 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a pop@@ e -- this falls to a group of 120 "@@ car@@ din@@ al elector@@ s@@ ."
In a statement announc@@ ing the new@@ s, Fa@@ ther Feder@@ ico L@@ om@@ bardi@@ , a Vati@@ can spo@@ kes@@ man, said a meeting of all the existing car@@ din@@ als would be held before the cerem@@ ony to elev@@ ate the new car@@ din@@ als, known as a consi@@ story.
"@@ Pope Francis has decided to communic@@ ate his decision to con@@ vo@@ ke Febru@@ ar@@ y's consist@@ ory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the participation of car@@ din@@ als from different parts of the world@@ ," L@@ om@@ bar@@ di sa@@ id.
J@@ ack Val@@ er@@ o of Catholic Vo@@ ic@@ es said that by February, the number of car@@ din@@ al elec@@ tors was likely to have dro@@ pp@@ ed.
He said usually a pop@@ e would name as many car@@ din@@ als as was needed to raise the number of car@@ din@@ al elec@@ tors back to 120 and as many car@@ din@@ als aged over 80 as he wan@@ ted.
Next year@@ 's consist@@ ory would be significant because it would be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Val@@ er@@ o sa@@ id.
At the moment there is a sort of bias towards Europe and especially towards Italy.
"@@ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will nomin@@ ate car@@ din@@ als from the rest of the world to restore the balanc@@ e@@ ," he sa@@ id.
For@@ ty perc@@ ent of Roman Catholic@@ s are in South America, but they have a tiny number of car@@ din@@ als.
The car@@ din@@ als will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Car@@ din@@ als, a group of eight car@@ din@@ als from around the world t@@ asked with looking into ways to reform the chur@@ ch.
In the past the Pope decided everything on his own.
"@@ Now Francis has selec@@ ted these eight car@@ din@@ als to help him@@ ," Val@@ er@@ o sa@@ id.
He said it was "@@ quite possi@@ ble@@ " that Francis would ask the car@@ din@@ als for ad@@ vic@@ e.
But we@@ '@@ ve not been in that situation before -- it@@ 's all completely new.
Val@@ er@@ o said pop@@ es typically elevated bis@@ hop@@ s from large places to the position of car@@ din@@ al but that Francis was "@@ full of surpri@@ ses -- so we don't know who he@@ '@@ ll nam@@ e@@ ."
GM rec@@ alls some new pi@@ ck@@ up tru@@ cks in U@@ .@@ S. to fix se@@ at@@ backs

On some of the tru@@ ck@@ s, the front seats may have a def@@ ect in the rec@@ lining mechan@@ ism.
As a result, the se@@ at@@ backs fail to comp@@ ly with federal au@@ to safety standards on head restrain@@ ts.
"@@ If the vehicle is struck from behin@@ d, the head restraint may not properly protect occup@@ ants, increasing the risk of inj@@ ur@@ y@@ ," according to the notice post@@ ed on the National High@@ way Tra@@ ff@@ ic Saf@@ ety Administration we@@ b@@ si@@ te.
The rec@@ alled models were built between August 1 and September 10@@ .
G@@ M@@ 's tru@@ ck roll@@ -@@ out began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the No@@ . 1 U@@ .@@ S. autom@@ aker since its 2009 bankruptcy restructur@@ ing.
GM told tru@@ ck owners about the def@@ ect in the first half of Octo@@ ber.
N@@ H@@ T@@ SA could not review the ow@@ ner noti@@ fication letter due to the 16@@ -@@ day government shut@@ down, which tem@@ pered au@@ to sales growth in Octo@@ ber.

An Obama vo@@ ter@@ 's cry of despa@@ ir
I voted for President Obama twi@@ ce, sharing hope in possibility of change
He says Obama has had worthy efforts th@@ war@@ ted by G@@ O@@ P obstruc@@ tion@@ ism
Ob@@ struc@@ tion@@ ism can@@ 't excuse Obamac@@ are we@@ b@@ site wo@@ es, dr@@ one attacks
Obam@@ a's 2008 campaign mem@@ o@@ ir is a sad reminder of what might have been
N@@ ath@@ ani@@ el P. Mor@@ ris is a second@@ -year student at Harvard Medical Scho@@ ol@@ .
I@@ '@@ m reading a terri@@ bly sad book these days.
It@@ 's a book that I thought would up@@ lift me during the dol@@ dru@@ ms of second@@ -year medical school, and ren@@ ew in me a sense of hope.
It@@ 's called "@@ The Au@@ d@@ ac@@ ity to Win@@ ," and it@@ 's a mem@@ o@@ ir of Barack Obam@@ a's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I@@ '@@ m finished with my patient write-@@ ups at night and get into be@@ d, the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions and speech@@ es could take your bre@@ ath away.
The election turned out to be a lands@@ li@@ de, and news anch@@ ors p@@ aus@@ ed to reflect on the historic nature of the hour@@ .
My class@@ m@@ ates cri@@ ed with jo@@ y, and my parents saved every newspaper they could fin@@ d.
A young team of vision@@ aries was headed for the White Hous@@ e, and the nation was ready for change.
During Obam@@ a's transition to office in 2008, he had an 8@@ 2% approval rat@@ ing.
And then I close the book@@ .
C@@ ut@@ ting to the present is a ru@@ de awak@@ en@@ ing, like sn@@ apping out of a dre@@ am.
It@@ 's hard to remember those days of optimism -- they seem a distant memor@@ y, a sad reminder of opportunities gone b@@ y.
Change indeed happen@@ ed, in the years since I cast my first ballo@@ t.
It was simply nothing I could have imagin@@ ed.
I credit Obama with great and vari@@ ed accomplish@@ ments, from the passage of the Aff@@ ord@@ able C@@ are Act to our military exit from Iraq, the end of "@@ don't ask don't tell@@ ," to the killing of Osama bin Lad@@ en.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstruc@@ tion@@ ism has u@@ pen@@ ded too many efforts to push our nation forwar@@ d: immigration reform, a public option for health care, and closing the base at Guant@@ anam@@ o Ba@@ y, among others.
But, after the countless times in which I have found my@@ self defending the Obama administration to colleagues and pe@@ ers, I@@ '@@ ve reached a limit to the explanations that I can provi@@ de.
I@@ '@@ ve reached a point of political despa@@ ir@@ .
Republican obstruc@@ tion@@ ism cannot explain allowing the bu@@ gging of foreign leaders, nor having d@@ ron@@ es strike innocent children overse@@ as.
It cannot explain having the National Security Agency collect data on the private lives of Americans, nor prosec@@ uting wh@@ ist@@ le-@@ blo@@ wers who reveal government wrong@@ do@@ ing.
It cannot account for assassin@@ ating Anwar al-@@ A@@ w@@ l@@ ak@@ i, an American citiz@@ en, without a tri@@ al, nor sh@@ ir@@ king public funding and spending limits during presidential campaig@@ ns.
It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White Hous@@ e's efforts to silence the media are the "@@ most aggressive ... since the Nixon Administ@@ ration@@ ."
And, most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple we@@ b@@ site more than three years since the Aff@@ ord@@ able C@@ are Act was signed into law.
I don't know if this is what I should have expected.
If, at 18 years old, I was supposed to figure out that governance may contradic@@ t the political campaigns that prec@@ ede it.
Obviously, elec@@ tive office is@@ n't a predictable course, as the opposing political party and rand@@ om events, such as the New@@ town massac@@ re, will shape our public convers@@ ation.
Yet, of all of the examples that I have listed abo@@ ve, they largely seem to be of the administration@@ 's own cho@@ os@@ ing.
That is what troub@@ les me most of all.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was exc@@ ited by his candid@@ acy.
Mitt Romney presented a conf@@ using and un@@ re@@ fin@@ ed alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his positions.
I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hope that we had heard of for so long.
Still, as Obam@@ a's approval rating sank below 45% this week, returning to 2008 through that book has become that much har@@ der.
It makes me year@@ n for the many promises that disappear@@ ed.
This week I was reading the portion of the book descri@@ bing how Obama suffered a huge loss to Clinton in the P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania primar@@ y.
At a post-@@ mor@@ tem campaign meeting, he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their cause.
"@@ I want us to get our mo@@ j@@ o back@@ ," he sa@@ id.
We@@ '@@ ve got to remember who we are@@ .@@ '
It@@ 's five years later, Mr. Presid@@ ent, and I co@@ uld@@ n't agree with you more.
The opini@@ ons expressed in this comment@@ ary are solely those of N@@ ath@@ ani@@ el Mor@@ ri@@ s.
C@@ live Pal@@ mer claims P@@ M Tony Ab@@ bo@@ tt has conflict of interest over par@@ ental leave scheme
Billion@@ aire M@@ P C@@ live Pal@@ mer says Prime Minister Tony Ab@@ bo@@ tt has a conflict of interest over his par@@ ental leave scheme because his daugh@@ ters might get pregn@@ ant and benefit from it.
The mining mag@@ nat@@ e, who is in a dispute about paying a $@@ 6 million carbon tax bill@@ , made the claim as he tried to br@@ us@@ h off questions about whether he had a conflict.
The Pal@@ mer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that may be crucial in deciding if the carbon and mining taxes are ax@@ ed.
But M@@ r Pal@@ mer claimed it was only ministers who could have a conflict of interest and said M@@ r Ab@@ bott@@ 's daugh@@ ters stood to personally benefit from policies.
"@@ He@@ 's got a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid par@@ ental leave because if any of those daugh@@ ters get pregn@@ ant, he@@ '@@ ll have a direct interest whether they get leave or not@@ ," M@@ r Pal@@ mer sa@@ id.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared M@@ r Pal@@ mer the winner of the Sun@@ sh@@ ine Co@@ ast seat of Fair@@ fa@@ x by 5@@ 3 vo@@ tes, after a re@@ coun@@ t.
M@@ r Pal@@ mer called for overhau@@ l of election counting to speed up the process.
Tony Ab@@ bott@@ 's daugh@@ ters Fran@@ ces and Bri@@ d@@ ge@@ t.
Should this election be decided two months after we stopped vo@@ ting@@ ?
"@@ We need to have a better system@@ ," he sa@@ id.
Why is it that we sho@@ uld@@ n't have a system where you can walk in, pun@@ ch your details into a compu@@ ter, vote immediately and have a result at 6.@@ 30 that nigh@@ t?
M@@ r Pal@@ mer also critic@@ ised the use of pen@@ c@@ ils to mark ballo@@ ts.
Is it because they can ru@@ b out the result if someone does@@ n't like it?
In this day and age having a pen@@ cil seems extraordin@@ ary.
The Elec@@ tor@@ al Commission has been stud@@ ying options for electronic voting and recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zeal@@ and.
M@@ r Pal@@ mer, 5@@ 9, said his policies included an international air@@ port for the Sun@@ sh@@ ine Co@@ ast and he would take "@@ very seri@@ ous@@ ly@@ " his new job.
Public office is about public servic@@ e.
"@@ We seek no rewar@@ d, except the reward of history that we can at a critical time serve this communit@@ y@@ ," he sa@@ id.
R@@ B@@ S suspen@@ ds two for@@ e@@ x traders
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division according to two people familiar with the situation, in another sign that the global probe by regulators into the suspected manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining trac@@ tion.
Some of the world's largest banks, including U@@ B@@ S, Bar@@ cla@@ ys, Deutsche Bank and R@@ B@@ S, have confirmed they are co-@@ operating with regulators in investig@@ ations into the world's largest financial market, where $@@ 5.@@ 3@@ t@@ n changes hands each day.
The two traders would be the first R@@ B@@ S employees to be suspended in the widening probe that echo@@ es the Lib@@ or inter@@ bank lending manipulation scand@@ al.
The bank, which declined to com@@ ment on the suspen@@ sions, confirmed this month that it has received requ@@ ests for information from regulator@@ s.
"@@ Our ongoing inqu@@ ir@@ y into this matter continues and we are co-@@ operating fully with the F@@ C@@ A and our other regulator@@ s@@ ," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation said that R@@ B@@ S had turned over records of em@@ ails and inst@@ ant messages to the UK regulator@@ , the Financial Con@@ duc@@ t Auth@@ ority, sent to and from a former tra@@ der.
This tra@@ der, Richard U@@ sh@@ er, left R@@ B@@ S in 2010 and is understand to have be given leave from his current position as European head of for@@ e@@ x spo@@ t trading at JP@@ M@@ organ@@ .
Roh@@ an Ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani, head of European spo@@ t trading at Ci@@ ti, went on leave this week, while Mat@@ t Gar@@ din@@ er, a former senior currencies tra@@ der at Bar@@ cla@@ ys and U@@ B@@ S, was suspended by Standard Char@@ tered this week@@ .
None of these traders have been accused of any wrong@@ do@@ ing.
M@@ r U@@ sh@@ er@@ 's inst@@ ant message group included bankers at Bar@@ cla@@ ys and Citi@@ group, people close to the situation sa@@ id.
U@@ B@@ S said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator@@ , Fin@@ ma, said it was investig@@ ating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities globally - the European Commission, Fin@@ ma, Switzer@@ land@@ 's competition authority W@@ ek@@ o, the F@@ CA@@ , the Department of Justice in the US and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are looking at alleg@@ ations that bankers coll@@ u@@ ded to move the currencies market.
H@@ S@@ B@@ C, Citi@@ group, JP@@ Morgan and Credit Su@@ isse have also launched internal prob@@ es or received requ@@ ests for information from regulator@@ s, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks are s@@ cour@@ ing through year@@ s" worth of inst@@ ant messages and em@@ ails to search for inst@@ ances of wrong@@ do@@ ing.
News about the prob@@ es has rat@@ t@@ led traders in an area that has been one of the bigger profit drivers of investment bank@@ s' trading units in past years but which has been challenged this year as low volatility in currencies cuts opportunities for specul@@ ators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the aff@@ air by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipul@@ ate, but senior traders are saying this is not necessarily true.
A senior tra@@ der said that despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trad@@ ing, the fragment@@ ation of liquidity between different trading platforms and bank@@ s" increasing use of their own internal platforms meant that "@@ you can start to get an impact on the market at quite small tick@@ et pric@@ es@@ ."
The news came on the same day as Credit Su@@ isse announced it had dismissed a tra@@ der at its London exchange traded funds des@@ k this week after he had caused a nearly $@@ 6@@ m loss late last year.
The bank promp@@ tly noti@@ fied the relevant authorities and has been co-@@ operating with its regulator@@ s.
"@@ We are confident the tra@@ der acted alone and that the matter has been contain@@ ed@@ ," Credit Su@@ isse sa@@ id.
Ho@@ ar@@ ding on the Be@@ cht@@ le p@@ lot pain@@ ted
A group bel@@ on@@ ging to the "@@ Schweizer Wi@@ es@@ e" citizen@@ 's initiative has given the ho@@ ar@@ ding on the Be@@ cht@@ le p@@ lot on the sp@@ a pro@@ men@@ ade in Bad Her@@ ren@@ al@@ b a fac@@ e-@@ lif@@ t.
In addition, they have clean@@ ed and widen@@ ed the foot@@ pa@@ th, a press release announc@@ ed.
The planned covering of the dil@@ ap@@ id@@ ated house to the re@@ ar of the p@@ lot was not permitted for safety reasons, as the pre@@ mis@@ es were at risk of collap@@ s@@ ing.
Al@@ fre@@ d Ab@@ el, who currently man@@ ages the si@@ te, arran@@ ged the '@@ fac@@ e-@@ li@@ ft@@ ' in cooperation with his colleagu@@ e, Rein@@ hard Dom@@ ke, from the citizen@@ 's initi@@ ative.
Before the citizen@@ 's initiative project, a bann@@ er with the message "@@ We are in fa@@ vo@@ ur@@ " was put up.
However, this did little to distrac@@ t the 20 or so members of the citizen@@ 's initiative from their project.
Their mo@@ tto@@ , on the large bill@@ board stated "@@ We are against un@@ finished build@@ ing@@ s@@ ".
In so doing they wanted to point out the danger of even bigger ru@@ ins on the Schweizer Wi@@ ese - should the huge project one day fail.
C@@ hat@@ ting with many people passing by the "@@ construction si@@ te@@ ", it became clear that many citizens believe the exec@@ ution of the project would make things much better for the tow@@ n, although many have the same questions as the citizen@@ 's initiative regarding the scale of the planned project.
However, they are beginning to resig@@ n themselves as the town continues to st@@ all in providing answer@@ s, said a statement from the citizen@@ 's initi@@ ative.
We have now been told that the public statements made by the May@@ or are also having an impact.
In May, in the meeting of the T@@ own Council, he said that he feared for the outcome of the sp@@ a should the population vote against the plans for a sp@@ a and well@@ ness complex on the Schweizer Wi@@ ese in the local referend@@ um.
Some appear utterly fri@@ ghtened by it, others perceive it as a "@@ b@@ lat@@ ant attempt to black@@ ma@@ il@@ " the population, continued the press release from the citizen@@ 's initi@@ ative.
The citizen@@ 's initiative th@@ ank@@ ed those who don@@ ated pain@@ t and all those who l@@ ent a hand.
Rang@@ ni@@ ck sc@@ ol@@ ding for ref@@ s: Man@@ e is no di@@ ver
As satisfied as R@@ al@@ f Rang@@ ni@@ ck is with the present winning form of the Austri@@ an Bundes@@ lig@@ a tab@@ le-@@ top@@ per@@ s, Red Bul@@ l Sal@@ z@@ bur@@ g, the S@@ por@@ ting Director of the "@@ Bul@@ l@@ s" expressed equal dis@@ appointment with the refer@@ e@@ es.
"@@ There is currently a dangerous tren@@ d, with Man@@ e and Alan being dubbed as '@@ di@@ vers@@ '@@ ," he said at a press conference in Sal@@ burg on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day, in def@@ ence of the two trick@@ y offensive play@@ ers.
The most recent cause for Rang@@ ni@@ ck@@ 's criticism was the y@@ el@@ low card for Man@@ e at 3@@ :@@ 0 against Gr@@ Ã¶@@ dig last Sun@@ day, whereby the Sen@@ eg@@ al@@ ese stri@@ ker was pen@@ alis@@ ed for supposed play acting - ad@@ mitte@@ dly this was not justi@@ fied, as shown by TV foo@@ ta@@ ge.
"@@ A b@@ lat@@ ant wrong decision@@ ," comment@@ ed Rang@@ ni@@ ck, who referred to H@@ ark@@ am as being "@@ completely out of his dep@@ th@@ ".
H@@ ark@@ am also played "@@ his part@@ " in the escal@@ ation between Sal@@ z@@ burg Co@@ ach Ro@@ ger Sch@@ mid@@ t and Gr@@ Ã¶@@ dig Tra@@ in@@ er A@@ di H@@ Ã¼t@@ ter after the game.
He firmly defended his German comp@@ at@@ rio@@ t: "@@ In each individual situation I would have beha@@ ved in the same way as Ro@@ ger Sch@@ mid@@ t@@ ".
Sch@@ mid@@ t himself did not wish to have any cont@@ act with his colleagues after the sk@@ ir@@ mis@@ h with H@@ Ã¼t@@ ter.
I do not know wh@@ y.
"@@ After all, I was the one who was insul@@ ted@@ ," emphasi@@ sed the 4@@ 6-@@ year-@@ ol@@ d.
However, with regard to the winning run, Rang@@ ni@@ ck s@@ ang his team@@ 's pra@@ is@@ es.
"@@ There are only two words for it: Re@@ ally good@@ ," he stat@@ ed.
There is not a lot you can critic@@ is@@ e.
Most of all, the manner in which the team is playing is impres@@ sive.
We must stay composed and keep it up.
There will hardly be any squ@@ ad changes in the win@@ ter transfer win@@ dow@@ .
There is no major reason to change any@@ thing.
"@@ Unless a player comes forward and expres@@ ses the desire to leave the club@@ ," explained Rang@@ ni@@ ck.
Supreme Court up@@ holds Obama health care law
In a major victory for the Obama administration, the US Supreme Court today ruled Barack Obam@@ a's sig@@ nature health care law is constitu@@ tion@@ al.
By a 5-@@ 4 vote, the justi@@ ces ruled the Pati@@ ent Protection and Aff@@ ord@@ able C@@ are Ac@@ t@@ 's individual mandate - which requires citizens to buy health insurance by 2014 or else pay a pen@@ alty - was constitutional under the tax@@ ing power of the government.
Chief Justice John Ro@@ ber@@ ts si@@ ded with the four more liberal members of the court while Justi@@ ces Sc@@ ali@@ a, Thom@@ as, Ali@@ to and Kennedy dis@@ sent@@ ed.
The court also up@@ held the remaining sec@@ tions of the 27@@ 00 page law, and further held that the health care law@@ 's requirement that states increase Medic@@ aid eli@@ gi@@ bility or else lose all federal Medic@@ aid funding is not un@@ constitu@@ tionally coer@@ ci@@ ve.
The suit to block the law was brought by 26 states and the National Feder@@ ation of In@@ dependent Bus@@ ines@@ s.
The law was vigor@@ ously opposed by each of the major Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary seas@@ on, including pres@@ ump@@ tive nomine@@ e Mitt Romne@@ y.
Nor@@ way@@ : Norwe@@ gian village lights itself up with huge mir@@ ror@@ s
Using huge mir@@ ror@@ s, the residents of a Norwe@@ gian village have brought light to their dre@@ ary val@@ le@@ y.
D@@ ue to the low level of sun@@ sh@@ ine, from autum@@ n until spring the village of R@@ ju@@ kan in the V@@ est@@ f@@ j@@ ord val@@ ley normally langu@@ ish@@ es in the shadow@@ s of the surrounding moun@@ tain@@ s.
With three gigan@@ tic mir@@ ror@@ s, each 45 met@@ res t@@ all, a centuri@@ es-@@ old dream came true on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day.
"@@ Fin@@ all@@ y@@ !@@ '@@ , ra@@ ved May@@ or St@@ ein@@ ar Berg@@ s@@ land at the in@@ augu@@ ral cerem@@ on@@ y, tel@@ ev@@ ised by broadcast@@ er T@@ V@@ 2.
Some val@@ ley residents lay back on su@@ n lo@@ ung@@ ers, while others saf@@ ely put on their s@@ ung@@ lass@@ es.
U@@ p until now, those hungry for sun@@ sh@@ ine in the win@@ ter had to travel to a near@@ by peak by c@@ able car@@ .
Ten years ago, local arti@@ st Martin Ander@@ sen presented the proposal of direc@@ ting the su@@ n into the val@@ ley using mir@@ ror@@ s.
However, this basic idea had been talked of in the location since 191@@ 3.
After several years of debate, the T@@ own Council finally approved the project, which cost 5 million k@@ r@@ one (@@ around EU@@ R 6@@ 15@@ ,00@@ 0@@ ).
A similar construction has provided sun@@ sh@@ ine to the Italian al@@ p@@ ine resort of V@@ ig@@ an@@ ell@@ a for a number of years.
The post is hardly ever emp@@ tied on Sun@@ days
"@@ Many citizens will not yet have notic@@ ed that red do@@ ts indic@@ ating a Sun@@ day post collection are still to be found on many post box@@ es in the town cent@@ re and its distric@@ ts. However, if you read the small print on the y@@ el@@ low box@@ es oper@@ ated by Po@@ st AG@@ , you will quickly find out that the box@@ es are no longer emp@@ tied on Sun@@ days and holi@@ day@@ s@@ ," announced the F@@ DP@@ .
An inqu@@ ir@@ y by the FD@@ P confirmed this.
Only the post box@@ es in front of the post office building at Ern@@ st-@@ L@@ ud@@ wi@@ g-@@ StraÃe 36 and at Jak@@ ob@@ -@@ M@@ Ã¼ll@@ er-@@ StraÃe 1 in H@@ Ã¼t@@ ten@@ feld are still emp@@ ti@@ ed.
Whether there are still Sun@@ day collec@@ tions in H@@ of@@ hei@@ m and Ro@@ sen@@ gar@@ ten is not addressed in the inqu@@ ir@@ y by the F@@ DP@@ .
The FD@@ P spo@@ kes@@ person for social and you@@ th-@@ related affairs, F@@ rit@@ z R@@ Ã¶@@ hren@@ be@@ ck wants to dig deeper into this.
The Sun@@ day collection is an important post@@ al service, especially in the case of scheduled po@@ st.
"@@ The company is radically and unaccept@@ ably cutting back on this, despite the price increase for let@@ ters in January 2013.
Thomas Bit@@ tn@@ er, Liberal Party Parliament@@ ary Group and Muni@@ cip@@ al Association Chair@@ man, is supporting his fellow group member@@ s: "@@ What anno@@ ys me, is the fact that the collection times have been changed or canc@@ elled on the qui@@ et here@@ ".
In so do@@ ing, the post@@ al service is miles off the mark when it comes to public accessi@@ bility.
"@@ At least the post box@@ es in the distric@@ ts of Neu@@ sch@@ lo@@ Ã and Ro@@ sen@@ gar@@ ten must still be emp@@ tied on Sun@@ day@@ s@@ ," said Bit@@ tner and R@@ Ã¶@@ hren@@ be@@ ck in un@@ is@@ on.
It is also the case for the town cent@@ re that those citizens in particular who are not mobile must also be able to access a post box with a Sun@@ day collection on foo@@ t.
In the T@@ own Parliament@@ , R@@ Ã¶@@ hren@@ be@@ ck asked whether the T@@ own Council was planning discussions with the post@@ al service regarding this matter.
May@@ or E@@ rich Ma@@ ier responded that the post@@ al service had not communic@@ ated with Lam@@ per@@ thei@@ m.
To the best of his knowledge, however, there is a Sun@@ day collection in H@@ of@@ hei@@ m.
Their party has spoken out in fa@@ v@@ our of priv@@ atis@@ ation.
"@@ Dec@@ i@@ sions will then be made else@@ where@@ ," said Ma@@ ier@@ .
Frankfur@@ t par@@ king fe@@ es to increase dramatically
Park@@ ing in Frankfur@@ t could soon be notic@@ e@@ ably more expen@@ sive.
The City Ma@@ gi@@ strate today discussed a sub@@ mission by the head of the depart@@ ment for transport, Ste@@ f@@ an Maj@@ er (@@ Green Par@@ ty@@ ).
According to the propos@@ al, par@@ king fe@@ es are to be increased by 50 per cent@@ .
This increase will not, however, be the result of raised prices, but rather the fact that time inter@@ val permitted by par@@ king me@@ ters and tick@@ eting machines will be reduced from 30 to 20 min@@ ut@@ es.
The City Council must reach a decision on this in Decem@@ ber.
The Ret@@ ail Committee of the Frankfur@@ t Cham@@ ber of In@@ du@@ stry and Com@@ mer@@ ce believes that this is "@@ not a good ide@@ a@@ ".
The option of par@@ king right outside their businesses is "@@ an advantage to smaller re@@ tail@@ ers that must not be under@@ estim@@ at@@ ed@@ .@@ ".
The Ver@@ kehr@@ sc@@ lu@@ b Deutschland (@@ German Tra@@ ff@@ ic Cl@@ ub@@ ) is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is "@@ completely appropriate and actually long over@@ du@@ e@@ ".
Lo@@ cal public transport will also become more expen@@ sive.
Fre@@ u@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ t: Qu@@ ick moves take ho@@ sts by surprise
With a sl@@ ender squ@@ ad, the T@@ S@@ V Fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt Herr@@ en I team (@@ Men@@ 's First Te@@ am@@ ) stepped into the Sch@@ iller School G@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ asi@@ um in Re@@ ut@@ lingen to face T@@ G G@@ Ã¶nn@@ ingen of the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b region.
The Al@@ b men stood on the other side of the net with what was undoubtedly a more experienced te@@ am.
However, it soon became evident that, due in part to their age, they could not really keep up with the fast pace of the Fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt te@@ am.
G@@ Ã¶nn@@ ingen found it extremely difficult to cope with the hard and well-@@ posi@@ tioned offensive mo@@ ves.
They repeatedly missed the pass@@ es and attacks coming clean@@ ly over the net from Sim@@ on Schen@@ k and E@@ du@@ ard Schul@@ z and their blocking game was not up to sc@@ rat@@ ch.
C@@ le@@ ar vic@@ tories in the first two sets clearly demonstrated the superi@@ ority of the Fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt team in all areas.
Fac@@ ed with this overwhelming and mat@@ ch-@@ determining performance, the third set was won following a somewhat t@@ ame and spi@@ rit@@ less performance, for a final score of 3@@ :@@ 0 (@@ 25@@ :@@ 1@@ 3, 25@@ :@@ 1@@ 4, 25@@ :@@ 2@@ 2@@ ).

In the B C@@ las@@ s, two teams from Ba@@ ier@@ s@@ b@@ ron@@ n and Fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt faced off in the M@@ urg@@ tal@@ hal@@ le in Ba@@ ier@@ s@@ b@@ ron@@ n.
They produced a hard-@@ fought two-@@ hour mat@@ ch.
Ner@@ ves on both sid@@ es, particularly when receiving the b@@ all, resulted in error@@ s and lost poin@@ ts; there was even a lack of passing at times and at some critical moments over@@ e@@ ag@@ ern@@ ess saw potential points wast@@ ed.
However, in this even@@ ly mat@@ ched game, the great physical effort of Mar@@ c@@ us Blas@@ ut@@ to@@ 's T@@ S@@ V team proved decisive in sp@@ ite of tremendous commitment by both team@@ s.
Main@@ ten@@ ance day at the small '@@ Eng@@ lÃ¤nder@@ h@@ Ã¼t@@ te@@ '
For what was then the fifth mainten@@ ance day in the follow@@ -up to the Natur@@ a 2000 project in U@@ pp@@ er Ho@@ tz@@ en@@ wal@@ d, a group of dedicated participants met at the small Eng@@ lÃ¤nder@@ h@@ Ã¼t@@ te (@@ Engli@@ sh@@ man@@ 's Co@@ t@@ ta@@ ge@@ ) in I@@ b@@ ach
Following sugges@@ tions from the population, the of the val@@ ley in the area of the co@@ t@@ tage was to be clear@@ ed, said May@@ or Hel@@ mut Kais@@ er.
According to Kais@@ er, many hi@@ kers ref@@ er to this area as the show@@ piece of the Sch@@ lu@@ ch@@ ten@@ steig@@ , where the landscap@@ e provides the ideal framework for fantas@@ tic view@@ s.
He th@@ ank@@ ed those present for their willingness to cooperate and emphasi@@ sed that the mainten@@ ance day is a su@@ itable instrument through which to strengthen the connection between people and nature,
He is offering every citizen the opportunity to focus on nature itself.
At the same time as the touri@@ st aspec@@ t, environmental aspects should also be taken into consider@@ ation.
This environmental aspect was explained by Fri@@ eder@@ i@@ ke Tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it of the Department of Nat@@ ure Conserv@@ ation of the Frei@@ burg Region@@ al Council, following the gre@@ eting by Region@@ al Counc@@ ill@@ or T@@ il@@ man Boll@@ ach@@ er, who had taken on the role of pat@@ ron and wi@@ shed the campaign every success.
According to Tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it, the touri@@ st objective of the vision coinci@@ ded with the goal of preserving the now extremely over@@ grown old All@@ men@@ d gra@@ zing pa@@ stu@@ re, with its specific protected habit@@ ats, through its opening and connection to the still existing gra@@ zing land.
C@@ ertain speci@@ es, such as rare but@@ ter@@ f@@ lies or gras@@ sh@@ op@@ per@@ s, cannot get past barriers in the form of forest areas.
They require these clear path@@ ways in order to preserve their speci@@ es.
Tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it said that she did not want to fail to use this opportunity to say a word in def@@ ence of the planned bio@@ sphere area.
The current measures do not integrate se@@ am@@ lessly into these plan@@ s.
A bio@@ sphere area offers the chance for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally reco@@ g@@ nis@@ ed Un@@ esc@@ o status, and thus offers an extension to what has been achieved thus far with the Life Project and the previous care days.
After the various stat@@ ements, forest ran@@ ger Christ@@ op@@ h W@@ eh@@ le and Life Project manager Cor@@ ne@@ li@@ a B@@ isch@@ off divided the hel@@ pers into groups.
The larger tre@@ es had been cut down in adv@@ ance, although forest trac@@ tors were on-@@ call if require@@ d.
One group of hel@@ pers were to take care of the clear@@ ance of j@@ uni@@ per bus@@ hes and the mainten@@ ance of a dr@@ y stone w@@ all.
The objective was to create a clear view at the view@@ point.

Goog@@ le, Sam@@ s@@ ung, Hu@@ a@@ wei su@@ ed over Nor@@ tel patents
The group that ow@@ ns thousands of former Nor@@ tel patents fil@@ ed a bar@@ rage of patent law@@ suits on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day against cell phone manufacturers including Goog@@ le, the company it out@@ bid in the Nor@@ tel bankruptcy au@@ c@@ tion.

Ro@@ ck@@ star is join@@ tly owned by App@@ le, Micro@@ so@@ ft, B@@ lack@@ ber@@ ry, Eri@@ c@@ ss@@ on and Son@@ y.
Google is accused of inf@@ ring@@ ing seven pat@@ ents.
The patents cover technology that helps match Internet search terms with relevant adver@@ tis@@ ing, the law@@ suit said, which is the core of Goog@@ le@@ 's search business.
Represent@@ atives for Sam@@ s@@ ung, Hu@@ a@@ wei@@ , H@@ T@@ C and Ro@@ ck@@ star could not immediately be reach@@ ed.
Sam@@ s@@ ung, Hu@@ a@@ wei and H@@ T@@ C all manufac@@ ture phones that operate on Goog@@ le@@ 's An@@ dro@@ id operating system, which compet@@ es fi@@ erc@@ ely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011 Google placed an initial $@@ 900 million bid for Nor@@ tel@@ 's pat@@ ents.
Google increased its bid several times, ultimately offering as much as $@@ 4.@@ 4 billion.
After losing out to Ro@@ ck@@ star on the Nor@@ tel pat@@ ents, Google went on to acquire Mo@@ tor@@ ola Mobili@@ ty for $1@@ 2.5 billion, a deal driven partly by Mo@@ tor@@ ol@@ a's li@@ br@@ ary of pat@@ ents.
"@@ Despite losing in its attempt to acquire the pat@@ ent@@ s-@@ in-@@ suit at au@@ c@@ tion, Google has inf@@ ring@@ ed and continues to inf@@ rin@@ ge@@ ," the law@@ suit sa@@ id.
Ro@@ ck@@ star is seeking increased dam@@ ages against Goog@@ le, as it claims Goog@@ le@@ 's patent inf@@ rin@@ gement is will@@ ful, according to the complain@@ t.
Egypt swe@@ ars in first freely elected president
Mohamed Morsi takes the o@@ ath of office but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark end of political stri@@ fe in Egyp@@ t.
IS@@ L@@ AM@@ IS@@ T Mohamed Morsi promised a "@@ new Egyp@@ t" as he took the o@@ ath of office to become the country's first freely elected president, succe@@ eding Hosni Mubarak who was ou@@ sted 16 months ago.
At his in@@ augu@@ ration before the Supreme Constitutional Cour@@ t, Morsi also became the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president and Egyp@@ t@@ 's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarch@@ y some 60 years ago.
He took the o@@ ath before the cour@@ t@@ 's 18 black@@ -@@ ro@@ bed judges in its Ni@@ le-@@ side seat built to resem@@ ble an ancient Egyptian temp@@ le.
"@@ We asp@@ ire to a better tomorrow@@ , a new Egypt and a second republic@@ ," Morsi said during a sol@@ em@@ n cerem@@ ony shown live on state televi@@ sion.
"@@ Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stabilit@@ y@@ ," said Mor@@ si, a 60@@ -@@ year-old US-@@ trained engine@@ er from the Muslim Brotherho@@ od, a fundamentalist group that has spent most of the 8@@ 4 years since its inc@@ ep@@ tion as an out@@ law@@ ed organisation har@@ sh@@ ly targeted by successive governments.
H@@ und@@ reds of soldiers and polic@@ emen guar@@ ded the building as Morsi arrived shor@@ tly after 11@@ am local time in a small mo@@ tor@@ ca@@ de.
Only several hundred supporters gathered outside the court to che@@ er the new president and, in a departure from the presidential p@@ om@@ p of the Mubarak years, traffic was only brief@@ ly hal@@ ted to allow his mo@@ tor@@ c@@ ade through on the usually busy road lin@@ king the city cent@@ re with its southern sub@@ ur@@ b@@ s.
Deri@@ ded as the Brotherho@@ od@@ 's un@@ charism@@ atic "@@ sp@@ are ty@@ re@@ ," his personal pres@@ tige has sur@@ ged since his victory and his delivery of a Fri@@ day speech that tried to present him as a candidate not just of Islamists but of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 upri@@ sing against the authoritarian Mubarak@@ .
"@@ Egypt today is a civil@@ , nation@@ al, constitutional and modern stat@@ e@@ ," Mor@@ si, we@@ aring a blu@@ e business suit and a red ti@@ e, told the judges in the wo@@ od-@@ pan@@ elled ch@@ am@@ ber where he took the o@@ ath of office.
Morsi later tra@@ v@@ elled to C@@ airo University where he was to make his in@@ augu@@ ration addres@@ s.
He was given an official welcome by an army band that played the national an@@ them as he stood to attention.
Military rul@@ er F@@ iel@@ d Marsh@@ al Hussein T@@ anta@@ w@@ i was in atten@@ d@@ ance.
His arri@@ val was gre@@ eted with chan@@ ts of, "@@ The army and the people are one hand@@ ," from the hundreds gathered in the universi@@ t@@ y's main lec@@ ture room@@ .
Establi@@ shed in 190@@ 8 as a bas@@ tion of secular education, C@@ airo University later became a stron@@ gh@@ old of Islamist student groups in the 1970@@ s.
Morsi took a symbolic o@@ ath on Fri@@ day in Tahri@@ r S@@ quar@@ e, birth@@ place of the upri@@ sing that ended Mubarak@@ 's authoritarian rule last year, and vo@@ wed to rec@@ laim presidential powers stri@@ pped from his office by the military coun@@ cil that took over from the ou@@ sted leader.
But by agreeing to take the official o@@ ath before the cour@@ t, rather than before parliament as is custom@@ ary, he is bo@@ wing to the militar@@ y's will in an indication that the contest for power will continue.
Mor@@ si@@ 's speech in Tahri@@ r Square was filled with dramatic populist gest@@ ures.

Rap@@ ist in South Afric@@ a: two life sent@@ ences
N@@ ine months after the brutal rape and mu@@ til@@ ation of a 17@@ -@@ year-old gir@@ l in South Africa, the perpetrat@@ or was condemned to two life sent@@ ences on Fri@@ day.
This was reported by broadcast@@ er SA@@ B@@ C.
The victim later died as a result of the serious in@@ juri@@ es.
Johannes Kan@@ a had already been found guilty of the crime at the start of the week@@ .
The crime had caused nation@@ wide horror@@ .
The then 2@@ 1-@@ year-old had rap@@ ed An@@ ene Bo@@ oy@@ sen in February in an industrial estate in Bre@@ das@@ dor@@ p, near Cap@@ et@@ own.
For 14 hour@@ s, doctors batt@@ led to save the life of the victim@@ , ultimately in v@@ ain@@ .
The sight of the young gir@@ l was so horri@@ fic that the car@@ ers and nur@@ sing staff required psychological support.
During the tri@@ al, Kan@@ a admitted to having been in a bar with Bo@@ oy@@ sen on the night of the attack.
He also admitted to be@@ ating and rap@@ ing her, however he denied being responsible for the death of the gir@@ l.
The police had initially assumed that there were multiple attack@@ ers, however, they released two suspec@@ ts from cu@@ sto@@ dy as the evidence against them was in@@ suffici@@ ent.
During the proceed@@ ings the public prosecu@@ tion also emphasi@@ sed that they were convinced that Kan@@ a was alone at the time of the attack.
Rap@@ es are almost part of everyday life in South Afric@@ a: There are around 6@@ 4@@ ,000 reports of sexual assault every year.
This is almost ten times as many as in Germany, although with a population of 8@@ 2 million people, Germany has a much higher number of residents than South Africa (@@ 50 million@@ ).
Poli@@ ce and wom@@ en@@ 's associ@@ ations in South Africa, however, estimate the number of un@@ reported cases of sexual assault to be 10-@@ 25 times as high.

Can ham bought in a super@@ market be as good as a quality produc@@ t?
U@@ li@@ , bo@@ ss of the large ham factory in Schwarz@@ wal@@ d, explained to J@@ umb@@ o how the B@@ onn@@ dor@@ f company, "@@ Ad@@ ler@@ ", oper@@ ates.
"@@ Germany's mo@@ st-@@ lo@@ ved ham@@ ," said J@@ um@@ bo@@ , pres@@ enting the Black For@@ est ham@@ .

Th@@ ought travel agents were a thing of the past thanks to the intern@@ et@@ ?
F@@ light Cent@@ re seem to be bu@@ cking the trend.
The company has upgra@@ ded its full year profit forecast and is looking to record earnings from holi@@ day@@ makers in Australia and the United Kingdom@@ .
The travel company now expects its full year underlying profit before tax to be between $3@@ 25 million and $3@@ 40 million, compared with the $@@ 30@@ 5 million to $3@@ 15 million it previously forecast@@ .
If the current guidance is achieved it will represent a 12 to 17 per cent growth on the record $2@@ 9@@ 0.@@ 4 million profit it achieved in 201@@ 1@@ /@@ 12.
Man@@ aging director Gra@@ ham Tur@@ ner said F@@ light Cent@@ re had made 8 per cent profit in the first half and had started the second half strongly especially in Australian and UK non-@@ business travel@@ .
"@@ Year@@ -to-@@ dat@@ e, our 10 countries are profitable and several are on track for record full-@@ year earnings before interest and tax contribu@@ tions@@ ," he sa@@ id.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are typically our largest profit gener@@ ators.
In Australia the lei@@ sure business re@@ bo@@ unded during the second half which offset a slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Simil@@ arly in the UK, F@@ light Cent@@ re@@ 's lei@@ sure business performed well while corporate cli@@ ents were spending less.
Its US business had recovered its losses during its seas@@ on@@ ally weaker first half and was expected to deliver its third con@@ secu@@ tive full year prof@@ it.
F@@ light Cent@@ re shares were up 3@@ c at $3@@ 8.@@ 20 y@@ ester@@ day.
Scho@@ ol@@ s urged to focus more on ma@@ th@@ s, sp@@ elling and gra@@ m@@ mar
English literat@@ ure cour@@ ses will require p@@ up@@ ils to study at least one Sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are pla@@ y, a 19@@ th century no@@ vel@@ , Rom@@ an@@ tic po@@ et@@ ry and contemporary British fic@@ tion from 1914 on@@ war@@ ds.
The ex@@ am will also feature "@@ un@@ seen tex@@ ts@@ " to encourage wider read@@ ing;
A combined English literat@@ ure and language course will be scra@@ pp@@ ed.
From 2015, p@@ up@@ ils will be required to take a stand@@ alone G@@ CS@@ E in language, with strong incentives to choose English literat@@ ure as a separate quali@@ fication.
The Department for Education is due to release the new sy@@ ll@@ abuses in English and ma@@ ths tomor@@ row - the first subjects to under@@ go a radical overhau@@ l.
It will make changes in other core subjects next year.
In a separate mo@@ ve, O@@ f@@ qu@@ al, the exam@@ s regulator@@ , will un@@ v@@ eil a shak@@ e-@@ up of the structure of G@@ CS@@ E@@ s, with a new gra@@ ding system and less cour@@ se@@ work.
Spe@@ aking in the summer, Michael Go@@ ve, the Education Secre@@ tar@@ y, said there was a "@@ widespread consensus that we need to reform our exam@@ ination system to restore public confidenc@@ e@@ ," insisting G@@ CS@@ Es would be "@@ more challeng@@ ing, more ambitious and more rigor@@ ous@@ ."
Stu@@ dies show that English schools de@@ vote less time to ma@@ ths - 1@@ 16 hours a year or three hours a week during term time - than in most countries.
By comparis@@ on, Australian schools provide an average of 14@@ 3 hours a year and p@@ up@@ ils do around 13@@ 8 hours in Singap@@ or@@ e.
While there will be no formal requirement to de@@ vote more of the tim@@ et@@ able to ma@@ th@@ s, Co@@ alition sources said the extensive ma@@ ths G@@ CS@@ E - combined with more weigh@@ ting for the subject in le@@ ague tab@@ les - was likely to encourage schools to provide extra teach@@ ing.
The sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us will place a greater focus on "@@ real world problem@@ s@@ ," including financial mathemati@@ cs.

Sal@@ em@@ : Joh@@ ann@@ a Rah@@ ner at the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Dis@@ cus@@ sion Forum
At the next E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Dis@@ cus@@ sion Forum on Mon@@ day 21 October, in the Neu@@ es Mus@@ eum des Sch@@ losses (@@ New Cast@@ le Mus@@ e@@ um@@ ), the focus will be on the top@@ ic of "@@ To hell with H@@ ell - The@@ ological reflec@@ tions on how we now approach the notion of end tim@@ es@@ ".
The spe@@ aker will be Joh@@ ann@@ a Rah@@ ner.
The E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Dis@@ cus@@ sion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protest@@ ant chur@@ ches in Sal@@ em, the Sal@@ em Cast@@ le and the L@@ ake Con@@ stance Di@@ strict Cultural Off@@ ic@@ e.
At the for@@ um, Joh@@ ann@@ a Rah@@ ner wants to address the question of how people today view the "@@ end tim@@ es@@ " after death.
While people in past centuries were overly conscious of it, focusing on the pic@@ tures of he@@ a@@ ven and hell "@@ that up until now have defined our ide@@ as@@ ", contemporary pro@@ phe@@ tic teaching on the hope of consu@@ mm@@ ation is character@@ ised more by a certain bas@@ h@@ ful@@ ness, or even speech@@ less@@ ness.
"@@ The greater hope has been well and truly cast out of Christians by religious critic@@ s@@ ," said the speak@@ er.
They have "@@ provided us with so many question mark@@ s, that we seem to have lost our exc@@ lam@@ ation mark@@ s@@ ".
Joh@@ ann@@ a Rah@@ ner continu@@ ed: "@@ However, the crucial challenge to this remains fear of death@@ ".
Associ@@ ated with this is the matter of that long@@ ing, "@@ that dreams that everything will be good at the end@@ ".
Joh@@ ann@@ a Rah@@ ner, born in 196@@ 2 in B@@ ad@@ en-@@ B@@ ad@@ en, studied Catholic the@@ ology and biology from 1982 to 1989 at the Al@@ bert L@@ ud@@ wi@@ g@@ 's University in Frei@@ bur@@ g.
In 1997 she gradu@@ ated as a doc@@ tor of the@@ ology, also in Frei@@ bur@@ g.
A post-@@ doc@@ tor@@ al lec@@ turing quali@@ fication in fundamental the@@ ology and ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical the@@ ology followed in 2003 at the West@@ f@@ ali@@ an Wil@@ hel@@ m@@ 's Universi@@ ty.
Since 2010, Joh@@ ann@@ a Rah@@ ner has occupied a Cha@@ ir for System@@ atic The@@ ology in the Institute for Catholic The@@ ology at the University of Kas@@ sel@@ .
Gei@@ s@@ lin@@ gen: More than 100 young Catholic@@ s from Kl@@ einer Heu@@ berg stand together in the confirm@@ ation of their prof@@ ession of faith
In two services, 10@@ 1 15 and 16@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds from the Am Kl@@ einen Heu@@ berg pa@@ stor@@ al care unit were confirm@@ ed.
In the mor@@ ning, the service was accompanied by the Lau@@ dat@@ o-@@ S@@ i Gro@@ up, while the after@@ no@@ on service feat@@ ured '@@ The Spi@@ rit@@ ' youth cho@@ ir@@ .
Up@@ on receiving the confirm@@ ation sac@@ ra@@ ment, the young people accepted their b@@ ap@@ tism and asked for the power of the Hol@@ y Spi@@ ri@@ t.
Over recent months those being confirm@@ ed, under the direction of De@@ ac@@ on R@@ einer D@@ eh@@ ner and the assistance of several ch@@ urch members, have been preparing for the special day.
In various projects, they learned of the different tasks involved in Christian ch@@ urch life and attended the You@@ th Day in Unter@@ macht@@ al together.
I@@ ll@@ men@@ se@@ e: Second moun@@ tain bi@@ ke race enth@@ uses participants
In fantas@@ tic we@@ ather, 2@@ 14 cyc@@ li@@ sts came to I@@ ll@@ men@@ see to take on the cir@@ cu@@ it, over the h@@ ills and around the l@@ ak@@ e.
This was announced by Ul@@ rich Kno@@ bel of the organis@@ ing I@@ ll@@ men@@ see S@@ ports Cl@@ ub@@ .
Among the participants there were also numerous am@@ at@@ eu@@ r cyc@@ li@@ sts who wanted the chance to practice their ho@@ b@@ by in a competitive environment, in particular over the short distance of 15 kil@@ om@@ et@@ res with a 300 met@@ re clim@@ b.
Two top-@@ class j@@ uni@@ or cyc@@ li@@ sts were also in the starting line-@@ up for the competi@@ tion: F@@ eli@@ x B@@ ader from Bad Wald@@ see and Pas@@ cal Tre@@ u@@ bel from A@@ ach@@ -@@ Lin@@ z came with the recommend@@ ation of having achieved good positions at the German Ch@@ ampi@@ on@@ ships.
The pa@@ ir managed to break away from the field in keeping with expectations.
As was the case the previous year, F@@ eli@@ x B@@ ader managed to hold on to a small lead right to the end and defended his ti@@ tle as the overall winner of the short distance race
Once again, Pas@@ cal Tre@@ u@@ bel took second place.
In the la@@ dies@@ ' race it was Ther@@ esa Du@@ ell@@ i of Team Al@@ b@@ traum who managed to take top place on the po@@ di@@ um.
In second and third places were An@@ ne A@@ del from I@@ ll@@ men@@ see and Leon@@ ie T@@ rei@@ ber from O@@ w@@ ing@@ en.
The increasing number of ri@@ ders that live or work in the area is a fantas@@ tic development.
And it was not only about top performance - the entire range of ath@@ le@@ tic ability was represent@@ ed.
Parti@@ cip@@ an@@ ts@@ ' ages were also wi@@ de-@@ ran@@ ging, with the young@@ est star@@ ters at ten years old up to the ol@@ dest at over 7@@ 0.
This year, there were even more absolute top ath@@ le@@ tes at the starting line for the main ra@@ ce.
Four cyc@@ li@@ sts managed to break away from the top regional ra@@ cer@@ s.
These included Phili@@ p@@ p P@@ anger@@ l, a semi-@@ professional moun@@ tain bi@@ ker from the Black Tus@@ k R@@ ac@@ ing Te@@ am.
Toge@@ ther with a team mat@@ e, P@@ anger@@ l has already twice been crow@@ ned World Ch@@ ampi@@ on in the 1@@ 2-@@ hour ra@@ ce.

T@@ rek@@ king through mu@@ d, ri@@ vers and jung@@ le to provide free medical care
Dr. Geor@@ ges B@@ welle is bringing free health care to rural villages in Camer@@ o@@ on
B@@ welle and his team spend almost every week@@ end seeing hundreds of patients
There aren@@ 't many doctors in the west African countr@@ y; just one for every 5,000 people
C@@ ast your vote here or through your mobile de@@ vice
Dr. Geor@@ ges B@@ welle is one of the top 10 CN@@ N Her@@ o@@ es of 2013.
You can vote for him, or any of the other top 10 Her@@ o@@ es, to be CN@@ N Her@@ o of the Year@@ .
That person will receive $2@@ 50,000 to continue their extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Geor@@ ges B@@ welle watched his ill father sli@@ p in and out of consci@@ ous@@ ness, travel@@ ing to hospitals that wer@@ en@@ 't equipped to help him.
Jam@@ ef B@@ welle was in@@ ju@@ red in a 1981 car accident near Y@@ a@@ oun@@ de, Camer@@ o@@ on@@ 's capital.
He suffered only a broken arm at first, but an infec@@ tion developed and spread to his bra@@ in, creating a hem@@ atom@@ a that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"@@ There were no neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons in Camer@@ o@@ on@@ ," Geor@@ ges B@@ welle sa@@ id.
We would have taken him out of Camer@@ o@@ on if we had the money.
Instead, B@@ welle spent years es@@ cor@@ ting his father to over@@ crow@@ ded clin@@ ics and hospit@@ als, getting whatever treatment they could ge@@ t.
"@@ It@@ 's not eas@@ y@@ ," B@@ welle sa@@ id.
You can leave home at 5 a@@ .@@ m@@ ., running to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.
There are a lot of pati@@ ents.
Some people can die because they are wa@@ it@@ ing.
The situation has@@ n't changed much since B@@ wel@@ le@@ 's father passed away in 2002.
In Camer@@ o@@ on, there is only one doc@@ tor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organiz@@ ation.
For comparis@@ on@@ 's sak@@ e, the ratio in the United States is one doc@@ tor for every 4@@ 13 people.
And even if they could see a physi@@ ci@@ an, many Camer@@ o@@ oni@@ ans co@@ uld@@ n't afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-@@ quarters of the country's health-care spending is priv@@ ate.
"@@ The only problem they have is pover@@ ty@@ ," B@@ welle sa@@ id.
And with poverty, they cannot enjoy their life.
Se@@ eing his father and so many of his country@@ men suff@@ er, B@@ welle was determined to do something about it.
Dr. Geor@@ ges B@@ welle and his team of volun@@ te@@ ers have performed 700 free sur@@ geri@@ es in the past year.
He became a doc@@ tor himself@@ , working as a v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar sur@@ ge@@ on in Y@@ a@@ oun@@ de@@ 's Central Ho@@ sp@@ it@@ al.
And he started a non@@ prof@@ it, AS@@ CO@@ V@@ IM@@ E, that travel@@ s into rural areas on week@@ ends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volun@@ te@@ ers have helped nearly 3@@ 2,000 people.
Almost every Fri@@ day, he and up to 30 people j@@ am into v@@ ans, tie medical supplies to the ro@@ of@@ s and travel across rough ter@@ rain to visit villages in need.
Their luck does@@ n't always hold out.
Th@@ ey@@ '@@ ve had to push vehicles through ri@@ vers and mud more than on@@ ce.
But when they arri@@ ve, they receive a true hero@@ es' welcom@@ e: a fe@@ ast@@ , sing@@ ing and d@@ anc@@ ing, and the best accommod@@ ations the community can off@@ er.
In these vill@@ ages, free medical care is truly a cause for celeb@@ ration, and B@@ welle -- with his big sm@@ ile and bound@@ less energy -- is more than happy to join in the f@@ un.
The next mor@@ ning, the team begins meeting with hundreds of pati@@ ents.
"@@ We are receiving 500 people in each tri@@ p@@ ," B@@ welle sa@@ id.
They are coming from 60 kilometers around the vil@@ lage, and the@@ y@@ '@@ re coming on foo@@ t.
Each of these week@@ end clin@@ ics provides a variety of medical care.
Many people are treated for malaria, tubercul@@ osi@@ s, mal@@ nutri@@ tion, di@@ abet@@ es, parasi@@ tes and sex@@ ually trans@@ mitted diseases.
Others might receive cru@@ t@@ ch@@ es, a pa@@ ir of don@@ ated ey@@ eg@@ lass@@ es or free birth cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates -- docum@@ entation that@@ 's required for school but that many impoverished families simply can@@ 't aff@@ or@@ d.
In the even@@ ings, the team will do simple sur@@ geri@@ es with local an@@ es@@ th@@ esi@@ a.
Oper@@ ations are usually done in a school@@ hous@@ e, town hal@@ l or hom@@ e; after the procedu@@ re, patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person@@ .
With the group@@ 's gener@@ ator ligh@@ ting the operating room and s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ ing equipment, B@@ welle and his volun@@ te@@ ers work into the early hours of Sun@@ day mor@@ ning.
It@@ 's a back@@ breaking pac@@ e, but village musi@@ cians usually help keep the team motiv@@ ated.
"@@ They are be@@ ating dru@@ ms all night to keep us aw@@ ake and continue our work@@ ," B@@ welle sa@@ id.
On Sun@@ day, the team heads back to the city, ti@@ red but proud of their work.
The group -- a mix of Camer@@ o@@ oni@@ an doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free sur@@ geri@@ es in the past year, and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help.
One man explained that the free her@@ ni@@ a surger@@ y he@@ '@@ d received will allow him to work again.
"@@ This will change my future with my famil@@ y@@ ," the man sa@@ id.
In addition to holding these week@@ end clin@@ ics and working as a hospital sur@@ ge@@ on, B@@ welle also works nigh@@ ts at private medical clin@@ ics around Y@@ a@@ oun@@ de.
It@@ 's this second job@@ , he said, that funds about 60% of his non@@ profit@@ ; the rest is covered by private don@@ ations.
"@@ I@@ '@@ m not sure when he sle@@ ep@@ s@@ ," said K@@ ati@@ e O@@ '@@ M@@ alle@@ y, a second@@ -year medical student from Dre@@ x@@ el University in Ph@@ il@@ ad@@ el@@ ph@@ ia and volun@@ te@@ er with B@@ wel@@ le@@ 's group@@ .
He is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaig@@ ns.
For medical and nur@@ sing students such as O@@ '@@ M@@ alle@@ y, who come from the United States and Europe to join B@@ welle on his mission@@ s, it@@ 's a hand@@ s-@@ on opportunity the@@ y@@ '@@ d never get at home.
"@@ We@@ '@@ ve been able to scru@@ b in on sur@@ geri@@ es where we help blo@@ t blood away or hold tools for Dr. B@@ wel@@ le@@ ," O@@ '@@ M@@ alle@@ y sa@@ id.
That@@ 's not something you@@ '@@ d ever get to do in America as a second@@ -year medical stud@@ ent.
The student volun@@ te@@ ers usually pay their own way to Camer@@ o@@ on, often arri@@ ving with don@@ ated medical suppli@@ es.
But once they arri@@ ve in Y@@ a@@ oun@@ de, their bo@@ ard, transportation and instruc@@ tion are covered by B@@ wel@@ le.
"@@ He@@ 's a her@@ o, without a doub@@ t@@ ," O@@ '@@ M@@ alle@@ y sa@@ id.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the Camer@@ o@@ on people is ever@@ last@@ ing.
For B@@ wel@@ le, the near-@@ constant work@@ lo@@ ad is@@ n't a hard@@ ship.
Hel@@ ping others live hap@@ pi@@ er lives, fulfilling a promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great jo@@ y.
"@@ I am so happy when I am doing this work@@ ," B@@ welle sa@@ id.
And I think about my fa@@ ther.
I hope he sees what I am do@@ ing.
To make people laugh@@ , to reduce the pain@@ , that@@ 's why I@@ '@@ m doing this.
Ch@@ eck out the AS@@ CO@@ V@@ IM@@ E we@@ b@@ site and see how to help.
Ma@@ stering the struggle to perfec@@ tion.
The role of S@@ anti@@ ago, the old man in H@@ em@@ ing@@ wa@@ y's novel "@@ The Old Man and the Se@@ a@@ ", is perfectly suited to Hor@@ st Jan@@ son@@ .
Jan@@ son is an old hand himself when it comes to his profession@@ , the art of ac@@ ting.
The old man, S@@ anti@@ ago, is the best there is when it comes to fis@@ h@@ ing.
As such@@ , the pa@@ ir comple@@ ment one another super@@ bl@@ y.
You almost think that you can see the fol@@ ds in the old man@@ 's nec@@ k, of which young fis@@ her@@ man Man@@ ol@@ o speak@@ s.
When S@@ anti@@ ago si@@ ts arch@@ ed over on the chair@@ , ti@@ red of life, this is a genuine emo@@ tion for Jan@@ son@@ .
Furthermore, the role of the old fis@@ her@@ man is a character role, through and through@@ , which Jan@@ son ma@@ sters excell@@ ently.
H@@ em@@ ing@@ way told the story of a figh@@ ter, a coura@@ geous man who does@@ n't give up and who ultimately wins the battle against the fish as a result of his knowledge and his strong will.
For long peri@@ ods, Jan@@ son is the only per@@ former on the stage.
He man@@ ages to focus the audi@@ enc@@ e's attention on himself@@ , with the result that his mon@@ olo@@ gues never become bor@@ ing, not even for just a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so genuine that members of the audience forget that the sea in question consists merely of water bott@@ les, ill@@ um@@ inated in blu@@ e.

Touri@@ sm@@ : Des@@ cent to the Rom@@ ans
Bene@@ ath C@@ olog@@ ne, a se@@ wage channel from Roman times, meas@@ uring around 120 met@@ res in leng@@ th, has been preser@@ ved.
Anyone visi@@ ting C@@ olog@@ ne cannot miss the c@@ ath@@ ed@@ ral@@ .
The two to@@ wer@@ s, meas@@ uring around 15@@ 7 met@@ res, extend into the he@@ aven@@ s, making it Europe's second t@@ all@@ est ch@@ urch build@@ ing.
However, only a few visi@@ tors who mar@@ vel at the two or@@ n@@ ate ch@@ urch to@@ wers reali@@ se that there is much to discover beneath the c@@ ath@@ ed@@ ral@@ .
R@@ ain@@ er Schul@@ ze is an expert when it comes to the C@@ olog@@ ne under@@ world.
The meeting point for his to@@ urs is the C@@ olog@@ ne Tou@@ rism Service Cent@@ re, right at the c@@ ath@@ ed@@ ral@@ .
The t@@ our begins in a somewhat un@@ spectacular fashi@@ on: "@@ We begin in the underground car par@@ k@@ ," says Schul@@ ze.
In the 1970@@ s, the city fa@@ thers wanted a car@@ -@@ friendly city, and therefore the only sec@@ tions of the old city wall that remain are those that were not too t@@ all.
The majority of the users of the par@@ king gar@@ age therefore now hur@@ ry past the Roman re@@ lic@@ s and simply drop off their car@@ .
However, anyone who takes a closer look on par@@ king level D@@ 2 will discover an arch@@ a@@ e@@ ological si@@ te, c@@ ord@@ oned off by met@@ al rail@@ ings.
Ru@@ ins meas@@ uring five met@@ res t@@ all, made from st@@ ones around the size of the pal@@ m of your hand, are waiting to be discover@@ ed.
"@@ These are rem@@ n@@ ants of the Roman city w@@ all, which was built in the second half of the first century A@@ .@@ D@@ ," explains Schul@@ ze.
Before returning to day@@ light, Schul@@ ze has participants take a gl@@ ance into a dark@@ , 15-@@ met@@ re sh@@ af@@ t on the upper par@@ king level.
This is the well of the old c@@ ath@@ ed@@ r@@ al, which is barely notic@@ ed at all these days.
The next stop on the t@@ our is the pra@@ et@@ ori@@ um, where participants once again desc@@ end to the dep@@ th@@ s.
Here we find the residen@@ ce of what was once the most powerful man to the north of the Al@@ p@@ s, the Pra@@ et@@ or of the C@@ CA@@ A.
One visi@@ tor wants to know what C@@ CA@@ A means.
"@@ The ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation stands for "@@ Col@@ onia Clau@@ dia Ar@@ a Agri@@ pp@@ in@@ en@@ si@@ um@@ ", which is basically amounts to "@@ City under Roman Law and City of the Agri@@ pp@@ ini@@ ans, founded under Em@@ per@@ or Clau@@ di@@ us at the S@@ ite of the Al@@ tar@@ s for the Imperi@@ al C@@ ult@@ ".
And the Pra@@ et@@ ori@@ um ref@@ ers to the former Govern@@ or@@ 's Pal@@ ace and the cent@@ re of power of the Roman Empire on the R@@ hin@@ e.
From the exhi@@ bi@@ tion v@@ esti@@ bu@@ le, a tun@@ nel leads to the preser@@ ved Roman se@@ wer@@ , meas@@ uring around 120 met@@ res in leng@@ th.
"@@ If you want you can take a peaceful stro@@ ll along a sec@@ tion of the so-called C@@ lo@@ aca Ma@@ xi@@ ma@@ ," says Schul@@ ze, encouraging the gu@@ est@@ s.
Schul@@ ze has one more surpri@@ se.
Once he has collec@@ ted the key from the information des@@ k, he leads the group to a 16@@ -@@ met@@ re, accessible sh@@ af@@ t.
"@@ We are now in the Mik@@ we, a ri@@ tual Jewish b@@ ath@@ ," he expla@@ in@@ s.
The Jewish con@@ greg@@ ation built their b@@ ath deep into the ground in order to reach the ground@@ water essential for ri@@ tual w@@ ash@@ ing.
To this day the differ@@ ing water levels caused by the var@@ ying levels of the R@@ hin@@ e can be read at the lower end of the Mik@@ we, the origins of which tra@@ ce back to the eigh@@ th century.
The Mik@@ we is to form part of an arch@@ a@@ e@@ ological area at the T@@ own H@@ all S@@ quar@@ e, on which construction work is set to begin shor@@ tly.
However, it will be a few years before it is comple@@ te.
L@@ eg almost hack@@ ed off@@ : Ro@@ cker re@@ trial
A bloody attack within the '@@ Ro@@ cker@@ ' scene is to be re-@@ investig@@ ated after more than four years.
Proc@@ e@@ ed@@ ings for attempted mur@@ der, griev@@ ous bodi@@ ly harm and material dam@@ age, brought against two 30-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds have begun before the Frankfur@@ t Di@@ strict Cour@@ t.
They are being accompanied by strict security precau@@ tions.
The accused initially remained sil@@ ent.
They are said to have been active within the Ro@@ cker scene and to have at the time belong@@ ed to the Ban@@ di@@ do@@ s.
The Public Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ or accused them of having stab@@ bed and be@@ aten three men in a car in Fin@@ ow@@ fur@@ t, together with unknown ac@@ complic@@ es.
All the victims were seriously in@@ ju@@ red, with one man almost losing a leg@@ .
The victims were said to have belong@@ ed to the competing gang@@ , the H@@ ell@@ 's Angel@@ s.
One is said to have been a high-@@ ranking member from Berlin@@ .
It seems that the attack was preceded by a car ch@@ ase involving several car@@ s.
According to accus@@ ations, this was part of a tur@@ f war and represented a demonstration of power.
The two accused were acqu@@ it@@ ted in an initial trial at the beginning of 2012.
At the time, a spe@@ aker for the court said that it could not be proven that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feu@@ d.
The as@@ sa@@ il@@ ants had wor@@ n mas@@ ks and had not been reco@@ g@@ nis@@ ed.
The Federal Supreme Court repe@@ aled the ver@@ dict following an appeal by the Public Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ or@@ 's Office and referred the case back to the Di@@ strict Court for a re-@@ tri@@ al.
One of the accused is currently serving time in an open prison on account of another off@@ ence.
Proc@@ e@@ ed@@ ings initially mainly involved the reconstruction of the series of events on the night of the cri@@ me.
The police inspec@@ tor responsible at the time was invited as a witn@@ ess.
The central point of focus was on mobile phone convers@@ ations between the accused and third parties, which the police had inter@@ cep@@ ted.
What makes things difficult is that Ro@@ ck@@ ers almost always ob@@ serve what they consider to be complete silence appear@@ ing before the court - they say absolutely nothing.
This also applies in the case of the victim@@ s.
In the first tri@@ al, only one of the victims spoke out.
When ask@@ ed, Public Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ or Ste@@ f@@ an Gol@@ fi@@ er of the Frankfur@@ t (@@ O@@ der@@ ) Public Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ or@@ 's Office said that new evidence had come to light since the previous tri@@ al.
A further el@@ even days of proceed@@ ings have been scheduled for the tri@@ al.
The thro@@ wa@@ way society does not think
The night was long, the musi@@ c lo@@ ud and the atmosphere good, but at some point everyone has to go home.
Ex@@ cep@@ t: In the stom@@ ach@@ s of those in the passen@@ ger and back se@@ ats, hunger strik@@ es.
Of course, this may be down to the od@@ d co@@ ck@@ tail or gl@@ ass of bubbl@@ y@@ !
So what could be more natural than to cas@@ ually pull into the next dri@@ ve-@@ through to pick your@@ self up a little treat@@ ?
I ad@@ mit, I am right with you with it comes to pi@@ cking up some fast food late at nigh@@ t, or early in the mor@@ ning as the case may be.
A few chip@@ s, a co@@ ke, a bur@@ ger - and then stra@@ ight home and into bed@@ !
However, on the way home the clear differences between me and other hungry club@@ bers become evi@@ d@@ ent.
What is wrong with people who continu@@ ally throw their fast food bag@@ s out of the car win@@ dow@@ ?@@ !
At the week@@ end in particular, dis@@ car@@ ded paper bag@@ s can be found at the side of the road and in car par@@ k@@ s.
"@@ Why is this@@ ?" I ask my@@ self@@ .
Are the people too stup@@ id to take their bag@@ s home or throw them into the near@@ est rub@@ bis@@ h bin@@ ?
After all, waste paper does more than spo@@ il the landscap@@ e.
Bag@@ s have also been seen covering transport facilities such as crash barri@@ ers, thus causing accid@@ ents.
However, the so-called "@@ thro@@ wa@@ way societ@@ y" does not think about such th@@ ings. They probably do not even know what the term even means.
If you are often out and about in the even@@ ing, more often than not with several people in the car@@ , you will know what a back seat can look like after having parti@@ ed through the nigh@@ t: clo@@ th@@ es, bott@@ les and other rub@@ bis@@ h begin to p@@ ile up.
A few bag@@ s won@@ 't make much of a difference there - in contrast to on the street where no-@@ one wants to tra@@ mp@@ le through other peop@@ les@@ ' lef@@ to@@ ver fo@@ od.
I can see the day coming when tow@@ ns and municip@@ alities will get fed up clear@@ ing up - and the fast food chains will have to operate a deposit scheme for their bag@@ s.
Obam@@ a's Health C@@ are Wal@@ k Back
Am@@ id a fi@@ restor@@ m of critic@@ ism, President Obama y@@ ester@@ day wal@@ ked back his of@@ t-@@ repe@@ ated, un@@ ambigu@@ ous promise that "@@ if you like your health plan, you can keep it@@ ."
With hundreds of thousands receiving canc@@ ell@@ ation noti@@ ces from their provi@@ ders, Republicans have s@@ lam@@ med the president in recent days for misleading the American public.
Y@@ ester@@ day, Obama t@@ weak@@ ed his original pled@@ ge.
"@@ For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that work@@ s, you can keep it@@ ," he said in a speech in Bost@@ on.
Ad@@ dres@@ sing what he called the "@@ fl@@ ur@@ ry in the new@@ s" about the canc@@ ell@@ ations, Obama urged Americans receiving these noti@@ ces to sho@@ p for new coverage in the market@@ place.
Most people are going to be able to get better, comprehensive health care plans for the same price or even cheaper than projec@@ ted.
"@@ You@@ '@@ re going to get a better deal@@ ," he sa@@ id.
The administration has said it should come as no surprise that the 5 perc@@ ent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to swit@@ ch plans because their coverage does@@ n't meet the new standards required under the Aff@@ ord@@ able C@@ are Ac@@ t.
"@@ Let me say directly to these Americ@@ ans@@ : you deserve bet@@ ter@@ ," Se@@ beli@@ us said in testim@@ ony before the House Energy and Com@@ mer@@ ce Committee in Washingt@@ on.
Se@@ beli@@ us, who is overse@@ eing implementation of the Aff@@ ord@@ able C@@ are Ac@@ t, said the launch of the online market@@ place has gone "@@ miser@@ ab@@ ly@@ " since Octo@@ ber.
"@@ I am as frustrated and angry as any@@ one@@ ," she sa@@ id.
I am eager to earn your confidence back.
An ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated Se@@ beli@@ us ut@@ tered that phra@@ se, caught by a hot m@@ ic, to an ai@@ de se@@ ated behind her at y@@ ester@@ da@@ y's House hearing following a conten@@ tious exchange with Re@@ p. Bil@@ ly Lon@@ g, R-@@ Mo@@ ., over whether she should be required to en@@ roll in Obamac@@ are.
More than three hours into the hear@@ ing, Long repeatedly pressed Se@@ beli@@ us on why the "@@ architec@@ t" of the Aff@@ ord@@ able C@@ are Act has not voluntar@@ ily for@@ gone government-@@ sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through Heal@@ th@@ C@@ are@@ .@@ go@@ v, which she is now pit@@ ching to millions of Americans.
The government in Jerusalem fails to confirm an attack on the Syrian air@@ force base
On Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day, an American government offici@@ al, who wi@@ shed to remain anony@@ mo@@ us, made a statement to American news broadcast@@ er CN@@ N, stat@@ ing that Israeli figh@@ ter plan@@ es had attacked an air@@ force base in the Syrian town of Lat@@ ak@@ ia the day before.
The target was "@@ missiles and related equip@@ ment@@ ", which the Israeli government feared were intended for the Lebanese Hezboll@@ ah, according to CN@@ N@@ .
The Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as Arab@@ ic broadcast@@ er Al-@@ Arabi@@ ya, had previously reported that the base in the port town of Lat@@ ak@@ ia was fired upon during the night from W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day to Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day, and the Israelis were identified as the responsible party.
Israeli television broadcast@@ er Ch@@ an@@ nel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Lat@@ aki@@ a, in which Russian S-@@ 1@@ 25 Ne@@ wa@@ -@@ type def@@ ence missiles and a bat@@ ter@@ y of S@@ A-@@ 3 missiles could be se@@ en, which according to Ch@@ an@@ nel 2 have a range of 35 kil@@ om@@ et@@ res and can transport war@@ heads weigh@@ ing up to 70 k@@ ilogra@@ ms.
Un@@ sure, the government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, press agency Re@@ u@@ ters has also quo@@ ted an anony@@ mous Israeli government official as saying that he believed that Israel had carried out the attack@@ , but was not su@@ re.
In any case, a spo@@ kes@@ person for the Israeli Ministry of Def@@ ence sa@@ id@@ : "@@ We are not comment@@ ing on these repor@@ ts@@ ".
Journ@@ alist R@@ on B@@ en-@@ Y@@ is@@ ha@@ i, writing for daily newspaper Y@@ edi@@ o@@ th A@@ hr@@ on@@ o@@ th, emphasi@@ sed that the Syrian regime had already previously attemp@@ ted, in some cases success@@ fully, to deliver ground to air missiles to Hezboll@@ ah.
The Israeli government had previously repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would be cross@@ ing a "@@ red lin@@ e@@ ", which would result in a military response.
John Kerry says US sp@@ ying has "@@ reached too far in@@ appropri@@ at@@ el@@ y" in unprecedented ad@@ mission
John Kerry has indicated a sof@@ ten@@ ing of the U@@ .@@ S@@ 's defensive stance on its surveillance programm@@ es with an unprecedented ad@@ mission that on occa@@ sions its sp@@ ying has "@@ reached too far in@@ appropri@@ at@@ el@@ y@@ ."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he@@ '@@ d been guil@@ ty, along with Barack Obama, of being on "@@ automatic pilo@@ t" as incen@@ di@@ ary revel@@ ations from wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower Edward Snow@@ den about the N@@ SA@@ 's sp@@ ying activities emer@@ ged.
The le@@ aks have put the US government at the cent@@ re of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Spe@@ aking to an open government conference in London via video lin@@ k, M@@ r Kerry sa@@ id@@ : "@@ There is no question that the President and I and others in government have actually learned of some things that had been happening on an automatic pilo@@ t because the ability has been there, going back to World War Two and to the very difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/@@ 1@@ 1.@@ "
He then became the first high-@@ ranking member of the U@@ .@@ S government to admit that US sp@@ ying had cross@@ ed the line, but emphasi@@ sed that no one@@ 's rights had been abus@@ ed.
He sa@@ id@@ : "@@ In some cases, it has reached too far in@@ appropri@@ at@@ el@@ y@@ ."
And the President is determined to try to clari@@ fy and make clear for people and is now doing a thor@@ ough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abus@@ e.
I ass@@ ure you innocent people are not being ab@@ used in this process.
M@@ r Kerry insist@@ ed, however, that the N@@ SA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He ad@@ de@@ d: "@@ We@@ '@@ re dealing in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up@@ ."
There is radical extremism in the world that is h@@ ell@@ -@@ b@@ ent and determined to try to kill people and blow people up and attack governments.
So what if you were able to inter@@ cep@@ t that and stop it before it happen@@ s?
We have actually prevented air@@ plan@@ es from going down, buil@@ dings from being blow@@ n up, and people from being assassin@@ ated because we@@ '@@ ve been able to learn ahead of time of the plan@@ s.
Meanwhile, U@@ .@@ S. law@@ makers will head to Europe to help address concerns abroad about alleged U@@ .@@ S. sp@@ ying and convince the Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-@@ terrorism efforts with the U@@ .@@ S@@ ., the chairman of a Senate sub@@ committee on European affairs said on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day.
Senator Chri@@ s Mur@@ ph@@ y of Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut said he spoke with European Parliament members and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-@@ terrorist organizations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agen@@ cy.
"@@ It@@ 's really important for U@@ .@@ S. national security interests for Europeans to stay on board with us with respect to our mutual anti-@@ terrorism en@@ dea@@ vor@@ s@@ ," Mur@@ ph@@ y, a first-@@ term Democra@@ t and chairman of the Senate Foreign Rel@@ ations Sub@@ committee on European Affair@@ s, said in an inter@@ view from Washingt@@ on.
And I@@ '@@ m going to Europe to make it clear to them that we need to continue to work together in combat@@ ting terrorism, not@@ withstanding their anger over these N@@ SA programs.
News reports that the N@@ SA swept up millions of phone records in Europe have fra@@ yed relations with some U@@ .@@ S. allies, though the agen@@ cy@@ 's chief said this week that they were in@@ accurate and reflected a mis@@ understanding of met@@ ad@@ ata that Nato allies collec@@ ted and shared with the United States.
Other revel@@ ations cited documents le@@ aked by Snow@@ den that the N@@ SA monit@@ ored German Chancellor Angela Merk@@ el@@ 's cell@@ phone and those of up to 34 other world leaders.
The national intelligence direc@@ tor, James C@@ lap@@ per@@ , defended sp@@ ying on allies as necessary and said it@@ 's common@@ place on both sides.
Am@@ id the u@@ pro@@ ar, Mur@@ ph@@ y said his office is arran@@ ging the congressional tri@@ p, expected to take place this year, and hopes the deleg@@ ation will include members of both parties and both ch@@ am@@ ber@@ s.
Nam@@ es of other participating law@@ makers were to be released in coming days.
He said the it@@ iner@@ ary is still being worked out.

However, CC@@ TV foo@@ tage later revealed she had returned to her ho@@ tel saf@@ ely after becoming separ@@ ated from her Australian boy@@ fri@@ end.
Ph@@ uk@@ et police inter@@ viewed B@@ am@@ ford for two days before she conf@@ essed to fabri@@ c@@ ating the story.
She was held in local police cells before the court hear@@ ing.
B@@ am@@ ford was sent@@ enced to serve the 15-@@ day prison term at a low security deten@@ tion cent@@ re on the outs@@ k@@ ir@@ ts of Ph@@ uk@@ et rather than in an adult wom@@ en@@ 's jail@@ .
She is the daugh@@ ter of former Australian le@@ ague player Peter T@@ unk@@ s, who has appe@@ aled to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Can@@ ber@@ ra to assist his daugh@@ ter.
T@@ unk@@ s told Sy@@ d@@ ne@@ y's Sun@@ day Tel@@ eg@@ rap@@ h the whole family was "@@ extremely concerne@@ d@@ " about his daugh@@ ter@@ 's welfare and wanted her back in Australi@@ a.
"@@ It@@ 's obviously been a worrying time but we@@ '@@ re hop@@ eful to have her back home saf@@ ely as soon as possi@@ ble@@ ," T@@ unk@@ s sa@@ id.
B@@ am@@ ford is appealing the sent@@ ence and has been granted bail of 50,000 bah@@ t.
Repor@@ ts in Australia said that in the meantime, she was holi@@ da@@ ying at the resort area of Kra@@ bi in Southern Thail@@ and.
Th@@ ai@@ -based legal sources said B@@ am@@ ford was being represented by a local lawy@@ er in Ph@@ uk@@ et but warned that the appeal may lead to the court increasing her sent@@ ence by up to two years and forcing her to serve it in an adult prison@@ .
However, following the recent murder of Australian travel ag@@ ent Mich@@ elle Smith in Ph@@ uk@@ et, Thailand may also be looking to repair its bat@@ tered touri@@ st ima@@ ge, leading to an acqu@@ it@@ tal@@ .
