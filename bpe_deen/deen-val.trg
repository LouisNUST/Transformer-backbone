A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral frau@@ d.
However, the Brenn@@ an Cent@@ re considers this a my@@ th, stat@@ ing that electoral fraud is rar@@ er in the United States than the number of people killed by ligh@@ tn@@ ing.
Indeed, Republican lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade.
One thing is certain@@ : these new provisions will have a negative impact on vo@@ ter tur@@ n-@@ out.
In this sense, the measures will parti@@ ally undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, the American States are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the regi@@ stration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon gained momentum following the November 2010 elections, which saw 6@@ 75 new Republican representatives added in 26 States.
As a result, 18@@ 0 bill@@ s restric@@ ting the exercise of the right to vote in 4@@ 1 States were introduced in 2011 alone.
The new election laws require voters to show a pho@@ to I@@ D card and proof of US citizen@@ ship.
Furthermore, these laws also reduce early voting peri@@ ods, inv@@ ali@@ date the right to regi@@ ster as a vo@@ ter on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal recor@@ d.
Before the 2006 elections, no US State required voters to show a pho@@ to I@@ D car@@ d.
Indi@@ ana was the first State to impose such a require@@ ment.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States up@@ held the constitu@@ tion@@ ality of the Indi@@ ana law.
The Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, they sponsored bill@@ s in 34 States to force voters to show a pho@@ to I@@ D car@@ d.
It is important to note that, unlike Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c, American citizens do not have a universal I@@ D card such as the health insurance car@@ d.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.@@ e. 21 million people of voting age, do not possess a pho@@ to I@@ D card issued by a government agency of their Stat@@ e.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identi@@ fication.
And it often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity car@@ d.
The new restrictions disproportion@@ ately affect young people, minorities and people with low incom@@ es.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of those earning less than $3@@ 5,@@ 00@@ 0@@ ; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the required pho@@ to I@@ D car@@ d.
And that@@ 's not all.
Stud@@ ents, voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use the pho@@ to I@@ D card issued by their institu@@ tion.
On the other hand, these same States allow fis@@ hing or h@@ unting clu@@ b members, who vote more Republic@@ an, to use the car@@ ds issued by these club@@ s when they vote.
Pri@@ or to 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Ari@@ zon@@ a was the first to introduce such a require@@ ment.
Since 2011, a dozen States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly intended to limit the His@@ panic vote.
However, it appears that two out of three His@@ panic voters fa@@ v@@ our the Democratic party.
What is more, in 2011 Republican legislat@@ ors sponsored laws aboli@@ shing the regi@@ stration of voters on election day in eight States.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wish@@ ing to regi@@ ster.
These restrictions are not without consequ@@ ence.
For example, during the 2004 general election, vo@@ ter regi@@ stration campaigns contributed to regi@@ stering around 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17% drop in the regi@@ stration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislat@@ ors have enacted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the early voting period.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Flori@@ da, 3@@ 3% of early voters were African@@ -@@ Americans, who accounted however for only 13% of voters in the Stat@@ e.
The same applied to His@@ pan@@ ics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 2@@ 4% of citizens who voted ear@@ ly.
On the other hand, 7@@ 6% of voters were white but these represented only 4@@ 6% of early voters.
Of course, Democratic legislat@@ ors and their supporters vigor@@ ously opposed the adoption of laws restric@@ ting vo@@ ter regi@@ stra@@ tion.
Several bill@@ s were blocked by vet@@ o@@ es of Democratic govern@@ ors.
The United States At@@ tor@@ ney General interven@@ ed to susp@@ end the most controversial law@@ s.
They were able to parti@@ ally limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the pres@@ entation of a pho@@ to I@@ D car@@ d.
However, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics den@@ ounce the partisan character of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective of influ@@ encing the 2012 results in key States.
A 2011 Brenn@@ an Cent@@ re report shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 17@@ 1 of the 2@@ 70 votes needed in the electoral college to win the Presiden@@ cy.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant imp@@ acts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain@@ : these new provisions will have a negative impact on the tur@@ n-@@ out.
In this sense, the measures will parti@@ ally undermine the American democratic system.
Pro@@ state cancer scre@@ en@@ ing: take the test or no@@ t?
Indeed, the P@@ SA test sometimes shows er@@ ron@@ e@@ ous results with false negative or even false positive resul@@ ts, which involve unnecessary medical interven@@ tions.
E@@ no@@ u@@ gh to make already reluctant men hesit@@ ate to take scre@@ ening test@@ s.
T@@ ake the test or no@@ t?
We asked two speci@@ alists for their opini@@ on.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contam@@ ination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and make firm recommend@@ ations.
Another stud@@ y, this time a European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who were scre@@ ened and those who were not.
This study also show@@ ed, with a follow@@ -up after 12 years, that it is between 30 and 40% more likely for met@@ ast@@ as@@ es to occur in the absence of scre@@ en@@ ing.
I therefore recommen@@ d the test from age 50, or 40 if you have a direct relative who previously had pro@@ state canc@@ er.
African@@ -American men are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detec@@ ted.
There are aggressive canc@@ ers and others that are ind@@ ol@@ ent.
The patient really needs to be made to understand the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering him the options available, not necessarily treating pro@@ state canc@@ ers that are not long-term life threat@@ en@@ ing, and op@@ ting instead, in such cases, for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer has been detec@@ ted will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life threat@@ en@@ ing.
Ac@@ tive monitoring will be sugges@@ ted, and if the disease progres@@ ses, they will be offered treatment.
More and more, specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who should or should not be treat@@ ed.
There@@ fore I recommen@@ d taking the tes@@ t.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doc@@ tor to determine whether or not to take it.
In collaboration with the Soci@@ é@@ t@@ é internationale d@@ '@@ uro@@ logi@@ e [@@ SI@@ U@@ ]@@ , Mo@@ vem@@ ber has created a tool that makes it possible to evaluate the pro@@ s and con@@ s of the P@@ SA tes@@ t.

Pre@@ v@@ enting the disease
Unfortunately, there is no mirac@@ le recipe for preventing canc@@ er.
Despite the progress in research, the adoption of healthy living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and exerc@@ ised enough, 30% of canc@@ ers could be prevent@@ ed.
"@@ If no more people smo@@ k@@ ed, this rate would increase to at least 50@@ %@@ ," says An@@ dr@@ é Be@@ au@@ li@@ eu@@ , spo@@ kes@@ man for the Can@@ adian Canc@@ er Soci@@ et@@ y.
On the other hand, it is estimated that roughly 10% of canc@@ ers are her@@ edi@@ tar@@ y.
Some are also completely un@@ expla@@ in@@ ed.
For the Can@@ adian Canc@@ er Soci@@ et@@ y, the fight against tobacco remains a pri@@ ority, despite the decrease in the number of smo@@ k@@ ers.
C@@ ig@@ ar@@ ett@@ es are linked to 85% of lung cancer cas@@ es.
It is also a risk factor for a number of others.
This mas@@ sively dam@@ ages people@@ 's health.
"@@ Even today, there are 1.5 million smo@@ kers in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c@@ " de@@ pl@@ or@@ es spo@@ kes@@ person An@@ dr@@ é Be@@ au@@ li@@ eu@@ .
En@@ coura@@ ging dat@@ a: 10 years after giving up smo@@ k@@ ing, the risk of dying from cancer dro@@ ps by hal@@ f.
Wei@@ ght
Over@@ weight and obes@@ ity are also condu@@ cive to the onset of the disease, according to the S@@ CC@@ .
They can increase the risks of cancer of the bre@@ ast@@ , col@@ on and rec@@ t@@ um, o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ g@@ us, pan@@ cre@@ as and u@@ ter@@ us.
"@@ Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout your life protec@@ ts against col@@ on canc@@ er@@ " it is also sa@@ id.

The organisation also recommen@@ ds limiting your consumption of red me@@ at.
In large amoun@@ ts, it increases the risks of developing c@@ olo@@ -@@ rec@@ tal canc@@ er.
Likewise, so do cu@@ red me@@ at products, and these should be avoide@@ d.
The conserv@@ ation of me@@ at by smo@@ k@@ ing, dr@@ ying or cur@@ ing can cause the formation of car@@ c@@ ino@@ gen@@ s.
"@@ They can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of canc@@ er@@ " it is expla@@ in@@ ed.
Vit@@ am@@ ins
In recent years, a number of scientists have studied the links between vit@@ amin supp@@ lements and canc@@ er.
For the time being however their research is in@@ conclu@@ sive.
Stu@@ dies on vit@@ amin E are contradic@@ tory, according to the S@@ CC@@ .
While one study noted a decrease in the risk of pro@@ state cancer, another noted an increase.
Also the effect of vit@@ amin D on cancer is not clear.
In addition, M@@ r Be@@ au@@ lie@@ u emphasi@@ ses the importance of discussing your concerns and family history with your doc@@ tor.

The Hig@@ gs bo@@ son revealed
The announcement of the prob@@ able discovery of the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son created quite a sti@@ r last summer, and with good reas@@ on.
Indeed, it is believed that this bo@@ son is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Uni@@ ver@@ se, no less.
Also it is the last par@@ ticle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Mo@@ del - our best or "@@ less wor@@ se@@ " explanation of the nature and behavi@@ our of matter - but which has not yet been observed empiri@@ cally.
But for physi@@ ci@@ sts, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Hig@@ g@@ s.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that it is a new auth@@ en@@ tic par@@ tic@@ le, and greatly resembles the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son predicted by the Standard Model@@ .
In addition, new data un@@ v@@ ei@@ led this week at a large physi@@ cs Congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but there are still insufficient data to be perfectly su@@ re.
But let@@ 's sup@@ pose that it really is the Hig@@ gs, since the chances of being mistak@@ en seem s@@ lim@@ , and see what it is.
In our world, there is a fat@@ ally unavoid@@ able law which states that two things cannot meet at the same place at the same time.
Ther@@ e's no way to break this rule - and don't try too har@@ d, you@@ '@@ ll go ma@@ d.
However, even though par@@ ticle physi@@ cs is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of the same kin@@ d: the Paul@@ i exclusion principle, which states that two par@@ ticles cannot occup@@ y the same space at the same time if they are in the same "@@ qu@@ ant@@ um stat@@ e" - this "@@ stat@@ e" consi@@ sting roughly of certain of their character@@ istic@@ s.
Bas@@ ed on this, physi@@ ci@@ sts classi@@ fy par@@ ticles into two categ@@ ori@@ es.
In one cor@@ ner we have good citizens called fer@@ mi@@ ons, who wi@@ sely o@@ be@@ y the Paul@@ i princip@@ le.
While l@@ ur@@ king in the other are the bo@@ son@@ s, a nasty band of anarch@@ ists who respect nothing - at all events, not this principle, which means that they can indeed be found in the same place at the same time.
These bo@@ sons are then divided into two groups, according to the Ber@@ kel@@ ey Lab@@ s Par@@ ticle Ad@@ venture site (@@ absolutely extraordin@@ ary, by the way@@ )@@ : mes@@ ons, which we will not discuss here, and "@@ force par@@ tic@@ les@@ " by which the great forces of nature are propag@@ ated and to which the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son may be somehow rel@@ ated.
These bo@@ son@@ s, it must be stressed here, are not all such exo@@ tic bu@@ gs as you might thin@@ k.
In fact, if you can read this ar@@ tic@@ le, it is thanks to an extraordinarily ban@@ al bo@@ son@@ : the pho@@ ton, or the "@@ light par@@ tic@@ le@@ " which is the "@@ messen@@ ger@@ " of the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic force.
Wh@@ en, in fact, a par@@ ticle having an electric charge acceler@@ ates or changes direction, this "@@ distur@@ bs@@ " the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic field in this specific place, rather like a p@@ eb@@ ble thrown in a pon@@ d.
This "@@ disturb@@ anc@@ e" produces an elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic wave (@@ of light, inf@@ rar@@ ed, ul@@ tra@@ viol@@ et et@@ c@@ .@@ ), and this wave is nothing other than a pho@@ ton - and thus one of the "@@ force car@@ rier@@ " bo@@ son@@ s.
More stable field
The same applies to the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son, with the difference that it is another fiel@@ d, the Hig@@ gs fiel@@ d, which must be "@@ distur@@ bed@@ " for the bo@@ son to appe@@ ar.
Now, this Hig@@ gs field is much, much more stable than the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic fiel@@ d@@ ; to exc@@ ite it, it is necessary to achieve ver@@ y, very high energy levels, rather like a fro@@ zen p@@ ond which would need a very large ro@@ ck to w@@ rink@@ le the sur@@ face.
Wh@@ ich is why a huge par@@ ticle acceler@@ ator like the one at CE@@ R@@ N - the Lar@@ ge H@@ ad@@ ron Col@@ li@@ der is a ring with a 27@@ k@@ m circum@@ fer@@ enc@@ e@@ ! - is needed to achieve such energy levels.
The analog@@ y with the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic field is again useful for explaining the relationship between the Hig@@ gs and mas@@ s.
In fact not all par@@ tic@@ les, or all materi@@ als, inter@@ act with the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic field.
Som@@ e, such as mag@@ net@@ s, do so, but others don't - a piece of pap@@ er, for example, will never stick to a fri@@ d@@ ge.
And lik@@ e@@ wise, not all par@@ ticles inter@@ act with the Hig@@ gs fiel@@ d: those that do so have mas@@ s, while the others (such as the pho@@ ton@@ ) do not.
Now, what is it that all this research "@@ can bring@@ "@@ ? as@@ ks M@@ s P@@ lam@@ on@@ don@@ .
For science, it serves to check the vali@@ dity of the Standard Mo@@ del (S@@ M@@ ), and also allows physi@@ cians to examine any discre@@ pan@@ cies between the observ@@ ations and predictions of the S@@ M@@ .
A number of people, moreover, fer@@ v@@ ently hope that some will be found@@ , because the sligh@@ test difference could open a door to a "@@ new physi@@ c@@ s" and plu@@ g certain hol@@ es in the Model@@ .
This, it must be said, still has huge shortcom@@ ings, offering no explanation for grav@@ ity (@@ o@@ op@@ s@@ !@@ ) or dark matter, which forms approximately 80% of the matter in the Uni@@ verse (@@ re-@@ o@@ op@@ s@@ !@@ ).
But to date no such discre@@ pan@@ cies have been found at CE@@ R@@ N@@ .
Re@@ percus@@ sions
The repercus@@ sions of this research on the daily life of the man in the street are more difficult to predic@@ t, but it would be wrong to assume that there won@@ 't be an@@ y.
Rem@@ em@@ ber@@ : in the very early 60@@ s, the pione@@ ers of the las@@ er at B@@ ell Labor@@ at@@ ories did not suspect the revolution that would be triggered by their work.
They had an in@@ kl@@ ing of the scientific applic@@ ations, but nothing as to the res@@ t.
In fact, the late Wil@@ lar@@ d Boy@@ le - a physi@@ c@@ ist who worked at B@@ ell Lab@@ s, where the las@@ er was invented in 1960@@ , and who himself developed the first continuous las@@ er (the first were pul@@ s@@ ed) in 196@@ 2 - told us that initially the las@@ er was rather seen as a "@@ la@@ b g@@ ad@@ get@@ ."
Just imag@@ ine@@ ...
And then, applic@@ ations can also come from all the instru@@ ment@@ ation that surround@@ s research.
For example, the same Wil@@ lar@@ d Boy@@ le developed a small light sens@@ or in 196@@ 9, during his work in op@@ tic@@ s.
This sen@@ sor@@ , although this was not at all the original inten@@ tion, now serves as an "@@ e@@ ye@@ " to all digital cam@@ er@@ as worldwide, and earned him the Nobel physi@@ cs prize in 2009.
This does not of course mean that the activities of the L@@ H@@ C will necessarily transform our lives, but it does mean that, ac@@ tu@@ ally, you never know@@ ...
Pal@@ li@@ ative care - The best way to die@@ ... | Le Dev@@ o@@ ir
With its D@@ ying with Di@@ gn@@ ity Commission, Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c recently discussed the delic@@ ate issue of the end of life.
The debate is due to resume shor@@ tly as a bill is being prepar@@ ed.
However, in this vital area, much remains to be done.
Le Dev@@ o@@ ir attempted to look more clo@@ sel@@ y.
Just a few weeks ago M@@ r L@@ . lived alone in his Mon@@ t@@ é@@ r@@ é@@ gie apar@@ t@@ ment.
The fes@@ tering pro@@ state cancer had allowed him a two-@@ year resp@@ it@@ e.
"@@ They gave me five years to liv@@ e, I@@ '@@ ve made it to se@@ ven@@ ," he say@@ s, with mixed emo@@ tions, lying in his bed at the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is pal@@ li@@ ative care home in Bel@@ o@@ eil@@ , where he arrived the previous day.
"@@ But it@@ 's still a sho@@ ck, you can never be prepared for it@@ " he add@@ s.
The disease is doing its work@@ : huge weakness which prevents him going to the to@@ i@@ let alone, and even e@@ ating alone.
Sit@@ ting in front of an appeti@@ sing lun@@ ch, he cons@@ ents to being helped to e@@ at, resig@@ ned.
C@@ oura@@ ge@@ ous, he even man@@ ages to sm@@ ile, talks to the stran@@ gers bu@@ st@@ ling around him, bringing him his medic@@ ation, offering him a ba@@ th.
The courage of ordinary death.
"@@ What I want most is to be cu@@ red of my di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e@@ a, it@@ 's humili@@ at@@ ing@@ " he confi@@ ded.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this ill@@ ness.
"@@ During our lives, we learn that a man p@@ is@@ ses standing up@@ ," says P@@ ier@@ re Bro@@ de@@ ur, psych@@ olog@@ ist at the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is home.
Re@@ gres@@ sing to the stage of a chil@@ d, for some people, is an unacceptable humili@@ ation.
"@@ It depends on the person@@ 's abilit@@ y" to accept the re@@ gres@@ sion, he say@@ s.
Bec@@ au@@ se, in the opinion of a number of people working in pal@@ li@@ ative care, great moments occur at the very heart of such re@@ gres@@ sion.
Pati@@ ents at the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is pal@@ li@@ ative care home all suffer from canc@@ er.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nur@@ ses surrounding them no longer provides so-called "@@ cu@@ ra@@ tiv@@ e" care.
For Mr@@ s A@@ ., 8@@ 9 years old, the worst fear is to die "@@ conscious and suff@@ oc@@ at@@ ing@@ ."
But the disease has made me discover my children.
"@@ I have fine children@@ " she add@@ s.
"@@ I don't wish for anything more in life@@ " she say@@ s, before accepting having a mas@@ k put on to help her bre@@ ath@@ e.
She looks forward ne@@ ver@@ theless, in the next few days, to a last visit by her son coming from Italy.
At Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is, a group of volun@@ te@@ ers provides bodi@@ ly care and help with feed@@ ing.
This is pal@@ li@@ ative care, given when there is nothing else that can be done.
To make death more comfort@@ able.
In Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c, there are pal@@ li@@ ative care be@@ ds for 1@@ 1,@@ 700 inhabit@@ ants.
This is very few when we know that we will all die one day.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains D@@ r Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel@@ , one of the doctors at the home.
Whether at a physical comfor@@ t, emotional or spiritual level.
A person who is dying will accept being helped to drin@@ k br@@ and@@ y or P@@ ep@@ si, whatever is their ti@@ pp@@ le.
Di@@ abe@@ tics no longer need to control their blood su@@ gar@@ .
And death is part of everyday life.
Y@@ ester@@ day even@@ ing, a be@@ er was served to M@@ r X@@ , who died during the nigh@@ t.
This mor@@ ning, it is his son who will fin@@ ish the be@@ er at the fe@@ et of the dec@@ eas@@ ed.
"@@ We help rel@@ atives as much as pati@@ ents@@ " says N@@ ath@@ ali@@ e S@@ av@@ ard, Director of Car@@ e.
At the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is home, one day follows another but no two are alike.
Al@@ ong with a 9@@ 3-@@ year-old man who is sa@@ vo@@ uring his last meeting with his family, sitting firmly w@@ ed@@ ged in his pil@@ low@@ s while to@@ ast@@ s are dr@@ unk in his hon@@ our@@ , a 3@@ 6-@@ year-@@ young man is dying tragi@@ cally, surrounded by his par@@ ents, his wife and his two young children, after having tried everything to survi@@ ve.
"@@ For six months, there have always been three to five be@@ ds which are occupied by cancer patients less than 45 years ol@@ d@@ " says a concerned D@@ r Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel@@ .
5@@ 3% of patients admitted to the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is home come from their homes, 4@@ 7% from hospit@@ al.
L@@ ack of access to pal@@ li@@ ative care
It is said that 7@@ 7% of Can@@ adi@@ ans simply have no access to pal@@ li@@ ative care, which is care designed to ease the pain when a patient has reached the termin@@ al stage of life, be it at home, in hospital or in a care home.
And a number of organis@@ ations, such as the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is home and the Pal@@ li@@ ative C@@ are Society in Greater Mon@@ tre@@ al, speci@@ ali@@ se more or less exclusively in care provided to cancer pati@@ ents.
It is precisely this large gap in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c health care which has made a number of pal@@ li@@ ative care physi@@ cians fear the adoption of a law on eu@@ than@@ asi@@ a and assist@@ ed suici@@ de.
Since October, a manifest@@ o, signed by pal@@ li@@ ative care l@@ um@@ in@@ aries including D@@ r Bal@@ four Mo@@ unt and D@@ r Bern@@ ard La@@ poin@@ te, has been circul@@ ating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initi@@ ative.
According to D@@ r Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel@@ , the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality pal@@ li@@ ative care before it is accepted to proceed to eu@@ than@@ asi@@ a.
Recently, she say@@ s, I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergen@@ cy, in great pain@@ , without anything being done to ease her suffer@@ ing.
I@@ '@@ m afraid that patients ask to die because they don't receive adequate care.
And at the same time, some on@@ c@@ ologists work relent@@ lessly on their patients until the last day, despite the worst progno@@ ses.
H@@ é@@ l@@ è@@ ne Rich@@ ard@@ 's survival hopes were already minimal when she ended her gru@@ elling ch@@ emo@@ therap@@ y.
When I announced to my on@@ c@@ olog@@ ist that I was stopp@@ ing the treatment, she told me she regre@@ t@@ ted that I had given up figh@@ ting, she sa@@ id.
However, she had told me I was fin@@ ish@@ ed@@ !
No all-@@ powerful care
D@@ r Mar@@ tel believes that 90% of patients asking to die th@@ ank car@@ e-@@ gi@@ vers for not having acc@@ eded to their request after they have been reli@@ ev@@ ed of their pain by a pal@@ li@@ ative care te@@ am.
But it must be said that pal@@ li@@ ative care is not absolutely all-@@ powerful in the treatment of pain@@ .
According to El@@ sie Mon@@ er@@ e@@ au, Pal@@ li@@ ative C@@ are Director with the Pal@@ li@@ ative C@@ are Society in Greater Mon@@ tre@@ al, patients are resistant to treatment against pain in 8% of cas@@ es.
At the very end of life, physi@@ cians then often resort to pal@@ li@@ ative sed@@ ation, which is equivalent to putting the patient to sle@@ ep until the time of death, either spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally or perman@@ ently.
We can no longer pre@@ tend not to understand this part of their suffer@@ ing.
Increas@@ ingly, an un@@ reli@@ ev@@ ed patient will have the option of having such pal@@ li@@ ative sed@@ ation.
Pati@@ ents who are not reli@@ ev@@ ed always say the same th@@ ing: "@@ I want to die@@ ."
But this does not necessarily mean "@@ I want you to eu@@ than@@ ise me@@ ," it means "@@ I want to be reli@@ ev@@ ed@@ ."
This report was made possible thanks to a journ@@ alism a@@ ward from the Canada health research instit@@ ut@@ es.
Wi@@ despre@@ ad real estate scandals in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c
Day after day high@@ way officials, building contrac@@ tors, political party fund@@ -@@ rais@@ ers and Italian ma@@ fi@@ a speci@@ alists tell what they know of a formidable "@@ system@@ ," combin@@ ing the building industry, government officials, politicians, trade union@@ ists and organis@@ ed cri@@ me.
An "@@ industr@@ y" which has cost Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c taxpayers de@@ arly, especially in the 1990s and 2000@@ s.
"@@ It is curi@@ ous how the system is crum@@ bling since we took drasti@@ c meas@@ ur@@ es@@ " says Jacques D@@ uch@@ es@@ ne@@ au iron@@ ically, a Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c politician and former Mon@@ tre@@ al Chief of Poli@@ ce.
It was through him that the scandal broke in 2011, in an in-@@ depth investigation into corruption related to road construction contracts in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c, to which the liberal Prime Minister at the time, Jean Char@@ est, had cons@@ ented only reluct@@ ant@@ ly.
The "@@ D@@ uch@@ es@@ ne@@ au report@@ " established a direct link between industry, under-@@ the-@@ table financing of parties and bri@@ ber@@ y of officials.
"@@ Since the inqu@@ ir@@ y opened in 2010, he say@@ s, the Ministry of Transport alone reportedly saved a billion dollars on contrac@@ ts@@ ," with certain people cur@@ bing their instinc@@ ts to get a shar@@ e@@ !
The Char@@ bon@@ ne@@ au Commission "@@ has already brought down two may@@ or@@ s" he add@@ s, hoping that it will succeed in "@@ reve@@ aling the schemes behind the individu@@ al@@ s@@ ."
A permanent anti-@@ corruption un@@ it, created in 2011
The Per@@ man@@ ent Anti-@@ Cor@@ ruption Un@@ it, created in 2011, is also coupled with its army of government analy@@ sts, investig@@ ators, and audi@@ tors.
Pl@@ us the "@@ Mar@@ te@@ au squ@@ ad@@ " polic@@ emen who, since 2009, have apparently led the Mon@@ tre@@ al "@@ se@@ wer car@@ tel@@ " to soft ped@@ al on the inflation of contrac@@ ts@@ ...
In recent weeks, it has conducted a series of search@@ es and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal politicians, such as Frank Z@@ amp@@ ino and Richard Mar@@ co@@ t@@ te, May@@ or of a sub@@ urban tow@@ n.
Next on the list is apparently G@@ ill@@ es V@@ a@@ ill@@ an@@ cour@@ t, who has just resigned from his post as May@@ or of L@@ av@@ al, third largest city in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c.
He is suspected of pock@@ eting repeated bri@@ bes in exchange for public contrac@@ ts.
Others formally accused are Mon@@ tre@@ al high@@ way engineers and Italian entrepreneur@@ s, including Tony Ac@@ cur@@ so and Lin@@ o Z@@ am@@ bit@@ o.
The latter caused a sens@@ ation by explaining the mechan@@ ics of the public contracts "@@ system@@ " to the commission@@ .
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Mon@@ tre@@ al to an intermedi@@ ary linked to the ma@@ fi@@ a who in turn paid the money to Union Mon@@ tr@@ é@@ al, May@@ or G@@ é@@ ral@@ d Tre@@ m@@ b@@ la@@ y's party.
M@@ r Z@@ ambi@@ to has handed money out freely in the 2000@@ s, giving over 8@@ 8@@ ,000 Can@@ adian dollars (@@ roughly 6@@ 8@@ ,000 euro@@ s) to provincial parties, especially the Liber@@ als then in power.
He also admitted having organis@@ ed an illegal fund@@ rais@@ er for former Liberal Dep@@ ut@@ y-@@ Prime Minister, N@@ ath@@ ali@@ e Nor@@ man@@ de@@ au@@ .
Se@@ wer contracts with infl@@ ated costs
In Mon@@ tre@@ al, the corruption "@@ system@@ " ran smoo@@ th@@ ly.
G@@ ill@@ es Sur@@ p@@ ren@@ ant, former public works engine@@ er, described it in de@@ tail in front of the commission@@ : in ten years, he received from construction companies gif@@ ts, inv@@ it@@ ations to tri@@ p@@ s, gol@@ f to@@ ur@@ n@@ ament@@ s, restau@@ ran@@ ts, ho@@ ck@@ ey mat@@ ches and bri@@ bes tot@@ alling 7@@ 3@@ 6@@ ,000 dollars, in exchange for se@@ wer contracts of which he infl@@ ated the costs.
Other high@@ way officials admitted having their pal@@ ms gre@@ as@@ ed by infl@@ ating in@@ voices by 30 to 40@@ %, and by false add@@ -@@ ons.
Then an organis@@ er of the May@@ or@@ 's party, Martin Dum@@ on@@ t, accused M@@ r Tre@@ m@@ b@@ lay of having deliberately closed his eyes to a parallel budget fe@@ eding his coff@@ ers with dir@@ ty money.
Following these revel@@ ations, M@@ r Tre@@ m@@ b@@ lay resigned in early November, plung@@ ing Mon@@ tre@@ al into a major crisis.
Ch@@ ant@@ al Rou@@ lea@@ u was one of the first women in Mon@@ tre@@ al to raise the alarm@@ .
May@@ or of the bor@@ ough of Ri@@ vi@@ è@@ re-@@ des@@ -@@ Pra@@ iri@@ es, to the East of the is@@ land, she protest@@ ed in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought for 5 million dollars and res@@ old for@@ ... 1.@@ 6 million to develop@@ ers, at the hei@@ ght of the real estate boom.
70% dir@@ ty money in election campaigns
On the investigation which will eventually be implement@@ ed, she says she "@@ is following a thre@@ ad in order to find out how the system - inf@@ il@@ t@@ rated by ants - work@@ s, to put a stop to the gang@@ ren@@ e and catch the culpri@@ ts@@ ."
The process, she say@@ s, is "@@ painful but positiv@@ e@@ ."
The wo@@ und is being clean@@ ed, but Mon@@ tre@@ al would need its own investig@@ ative unit with ongoing monit@@ or@@ ing, to avoid the return of these question@@ able practices.
How to clean hous@@ e.
Pro@@ per@@ ly.
Jacques D@@ uch@@ es@@ ne@@ au no@@ tes for his part that "@@ officials stol@@ e hundreds of millions of dollar@@ s@@ ," but he is especially concerned about the role of "@@ elected people aware of the schem@@ e@@ ," when they were not up to their nec@@ ks in the sc@@ am@@ !
E@@ stim@@ ating the share of dir@@ ty money in the financing of election campaigns in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c at 70@@ %, he says dr@@ y@@ ly@@ : "@@ I was told that it was only a p@@ ale reflection of re@@ alit@@ y@@ ."
The Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c government propos@@ es to limit don@@ ations to parties to 100 dollars, but this will not change the situation, he say@@ s: "@@ Until election expen@@ ses are strictly limited, there will be dir@@ ty money in politic@@ s@@ ."
He advocates a complete overhau@@ l of the system for gran@@ ting public contracts and party fund@@ ing: "@@ We can@@ 't go any lower@@ ; getting to the bottom of things, with coura@@ ge, will help to rebuild the house on more solid found@@ ations, with more controls and law@@ s@@ ."
Although this story tar@@ nis@@ hes the international image of Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c and Mon@@ tre@@ al, M@@ r D@@ uch@@ es@@ ne@@ au inv@@ ites anyone laugh@@ ing to look in their own back@@ y@@ ard@@ ...
"@@ P@@ S@@ G is not F@@ C Barcelon@@ a@@ !@@ "
This seas@@ on, you have taken on a new stat@@ ure with P@@ S@@ G@@ .
How do you explain this progres@@ sion@@ ?
It can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of P@@ S@@ G@@ .
Some great players have arri@@ ved.
Every day I@@ '@@ m making progress alongside them.
The technical staff has also brought me a lo@@ t.
Day by day, all these things help me raise my level of play.
And, in a mat@@ ch, it@@ 's easi@@ er.
Every@@ thing moves very fast in foot@@ b@@ all.
But I don't get worked up.
From my de@@ but at the C@@ la@@ i@@ ref@@ on@@ ta@@ ine IN@@ F pre-@@ training cent@@ re to my transfer to S@@ ain@@ t-@@ E@@ ti@@ en@@ ne, I@@ '@@ ve always moved step by step@@ .
So you benefit from the competition brought in by Car@@ lo An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti@@ ...
This sum@@ mer@@ 's recru@@ its are used to playing mat@@ ches at a high level.
They also know that every training s@@ ession is cruci@@ al.
Wh@@ ich is what makes a player like me want to face up and give my best.
On the other hand, Car@@ lo An@@ cel@@ o@@ tt@@ i gives me a lot as regards my position.
He@@ 's supported by dep@@ u@@ ties like Claude Mak@@ el@@ el@@ e, who played in the same position as me.
Is An@@ cel@@ o@@ tt@@ i the man for the job@@ ?
Def@@ in@@ it@@ ely.
An@@ cel@@ o@@ tt@@ i inspi@@ res respect among all the exper@@ ts.
Toda@@ y he has no equal in L@@ ig@@ ue 1, and he@@ 's one of the best co@@ ach@@ es in Europe.
He has mass@@ es of experience and has won many tit@@ les with top club@@ s.
He@@ 's worked with great play@@ ers.
I think he will bring more tit@@ les to Par@@ is.
In January, I had an encouraging discussion with him.
I was just coming back from a series of in@@ juri@@ es.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What importance do you att@@ ach to the first part of the seas@@ on for P@@ S@@ G@@ ?
In L@@ ig@@ ue 1, L@@ y@@ on over@@ took us at the top@@ .
But we@@ '@@ re waiting on the sid@@ el@@ ines.
One of our main goals is the Ch@@ ampi@@ ons Le@@ agu@@ e: we qualified for the last 16 in the right way.
What is the club@@ 's goal in this competi@@ tion?
We@@ '@@ ll try to go as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we@@ '@@ ll have something to say against some very good European team@@ s.
First of all, we want to fin@@ ish top in our pool@@ , ahead of Por@@ to, to have home advantage in the last 16 mat@@ ch.
Can P@@ S@@ G become a top European clu@@ b in the short term@@ ?
It already has the budget@@ ...
To become a top European club@@ , Paris needs to win tit@@ les and keep it up over time.
Today, this is@@ n't the case.
Finan@@ ci@@ ally, P@@ S@@ G has the means to make it happen.
In L@@ ig@@ ue 1, would not winning the tit@@ le, like last seas@@ on, be a big fail@@ ure@@ ?
Def@@ in@@ it@@ ely, it would be a major disappoint@@ ment.
This year, we@@ '@@ re really committed to winning the champi@@ on@@ ship.
We wer@@ en@@ 't far away last seas@@ on.
In May, there was great dis@@ appointment because we were good enough to fin@@ ish first.
It was a terri@@ fic seas@@ on.
We finished with 7@@ 9 poin@@ ts.
Nor@@ m@@ ally, 7@@ 9 points is good enough to be top@@ ...
But another te@@ am, Mon@@ t@@ pel@@ li@@ er, had an even more fantas@@ tic seas@@ on.
I think this is the year.
Even if big teams like Mar@@ sei@@ l@@ le, L@@ y@@ on and Bor@@ de@@ au@@ x are competing for the tit@@ le, I think we have the weapons to win@@ .
Do you think the media expect too much of P@@ S@@ G@@ ?
It@@ 's normal for them to expect a lot from us given what@@ 's been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
After we won 4-@@ 0 at home against Tro@@ y@@ es and they still found things to blame us for, that@@ 's definit@@ ely a bit frustrat@@ ing.
You wonder what more people expec@@ t.
You@@ '@@ re never going to win 4-@@ 0 every week@@ end.
We@@ '@@ re not F@@ C Barcelon@@ a@@ !
We@@ '@@ re trying to implement a game project.
It takes time to build a te@@ am.
The Ch@@ ampi@@ ons League proved we could hold our own.
Lo@@ ok at Man@@ chest@@ er City who, for two seas@@ ons, have failed to quali@@ fy for the last 1@@ 6, despite also having spent huge amoun@@ ts@@ !
Bas@@ ed on the amounts inves@@ ted, you should be 15 points ahead at the win@@ ter break@@ !
That would be to ignore our opponents and the French Ch@@ ampi@@ on@@ ship.
L@@ y@@ on and Mar@@ sei@@ l@@ le, who were no good last seas@@ on, were "@@ boo@@ st@@ ed@@ " by the new P@@ S@@ G@@ .
This shows that L@@ ig@@ ue 1 is exc@@ it@@ ing.
I hope that in May we will be able to sm@@ ile in saying that, despite all the difficul@@ ties, we finally did it.
P@@ S@@ G seem totally dependent on the explo@@ its of Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic@@ .
So much so that people say there is a "@@ Z@@ lat@@ an depen@@ denc@@ e@@ ."
This means Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic is very successful and scores a lot of goals.
That@@ 's why he cam@@ e, and he@@ 's proving he@@ 's the star of L@@ ig@@ ue 1.
He@@ 's demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great play@@ er, a world star@@ .
Within the group, we respect the man and the play@@ er.
And also he respec@@ ts the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly excep@@ tion@@ al.
It push@@ es others to raise their level of play.
Th@@ i@@ ago Sil@@ va, who is one of the best defen@@ ders in the world, also helps everyone else progress.
How did you get on in Euro 2012 with the France team@@ ?
A disappoint@@ ment.
I really wanted to play in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my inj@@ ury prevented me from getting any game time.
I saw some things there and came out stron@@ ger.
Today, I@@ '@@ m playing well in selection mat@@ ch@@ es.
Wh@@ ich is what I@@ '@@ ve been hoping for since my b@@ ap@@ tism with the Blu@@ es.
I@@ '@@ ve learned the lessons from what happened in the Ukraine and I now owe it to my@@ self to have ex@@ empl@@ ary behavi@@ our@@ .
What do think about Di@@ di@@ er Des@@ ch@@ amp@@ s@@ 's first few months in charge of the Blu@@ es?
He has the results he wan@@ ted.
We@@ '@@ re well placed in the World quali@@ fying group@@ .
The co@@ ach is tough@@ , close to the play@@ ers, and inspi@@ res them to win@@ .
Like Lau@@ rent B@@ lan@@ c was.
But I don't want to make any comparis@@ ons.
B@@ lan@@ c had achieved his goal when we qualified for the Euro.
I hope Di@@ di@@ er Des@@ ch@@ amp@@ s will take the Blu@@ es to Braz@@ il.
Di@@ d the good draw (@@ 1-@@ 1) s@@ nat@@ ched in Spain, on 16 October, represent a founding mat@@ ch@@ ?
That match gave us confidence.
Every@@ body fought for every@@ bod@@ y.
Before that shock in Spain, I@@ '@@ d never experienced such a match in my care@@ er.
With Bit@@ co@@ in, pay and sell without banks
The opposite of current monetary exchan@@ ges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fe@@ es among the parties involved.
In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is pal@@ p@@ able: the belief that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopoli@@ es, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bit@@ co@@ in, invented by Sat@@ o@@ sh@@ i N@@ ak@@ am@@ o@@ to (a p@@ se@@ ud@@ ony@@ m@@ ), is both a virtual currency (@@ but conver@@ tible into dollars, euro@@ s) and a secure exchange proto@@ col like Bit@@ Tor@@ r@@ ent, which allows pe@@ er-@@ to-@@ peer f@@ ile ex@@ change.
Around 200@@ ,000 transactions have already been recorded via 15@@ ,000 computers on the net@@ work.
C@@ lose to a thousand we@@ b sites accept bit@@ co@@ ins as don@@ ations or means of pay@@ ment.
The bit@@ co@@ in exchange rate, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (@@ 23 euro@@ s) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, returning today to around a dozen dollars (@@ rates are listed on the bit@@ co@@ in@@ char@@ ts@@ .@@ com si@@ te).
Nothing very impres@@ sive, compared to global transactions in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (@@ ECB@@ ) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in Octo@@ ber.
It describes bit@@ co@@ in as "the most successful virtual currency@@ ," "@@ in competition with the dollar or the euro@@ " and "@@ similar to conventional curren@@ ci@@ es@@ ."
Bit@@ co@@ in diff@@ ers from other types of virtual currency such as '@@ credi@@ ts@@ '@@ , used to progress in a video game which you win by playing or which you can buy (and sometimes exchange in retur@@ n@@ ).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But, on each occa@@ sion, a central authority controls and hand@@ les the exchan@@ ges.
With Bit@@ co@@ in, all no@@ des in the network are both cu@@ sto@@ di@@ ans of the book of accoun@@ ts, audi@@ tors, currency issu@@ ers, and buyers and sell@@ ers.
How does the network oper@@ at@@ e?
Each transaction between two users is actually carried out between two electronic addres@@ ses like with an e-@@ ma@@ il.
Ex@@ cep@@ t that a us@@ er can choose a different address for each pay@@ ment, thereby ensuring anony@@ mit@@ y.
A set of information associated with this transaction is signed electron@@ ically by a du@@ al-@@ key enc@@ r@@ yp@@ tion system.
So the network can veri@@ fy the auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity of the trans@@ action.
Using the cont@@ ents of the fi@@ le, it is also possible to ensure that the ex@@ changed bit@@ co@@ ins exist in the public book of accoun@@ ts, broad@@ cast across the entire net@@ work.
The key step is entering the new transaction in the book@@ .
It pass@@ es through the resolution of a mathemati@@ cal challenge issued to the compu@@ ters, and the winn@@ er, a kind of interim central bank@@ er, will have the privi@@ lege of adding this extra line.
This is a f@@ ile h@@ ash@@ ing phas@@ e, i.@@ e. the transformation of a large f@@ ile into a shor@@ ter and unique digital imp@@ rin@@ t.
Compu@@ ters "@@ tak@@ e" the new transaction and add a number to it, then "@@ h@@ ash@@ " it all up.
The goal being to find the number that gives a special imp@@ rin@@ t (@@ lo@@ ts of zer@@ os at the beginn@@ ing@@ ).
Once this number has been found@@ , the other no@@ des can easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then in@@ destruc@@ ti@@ bly linked to the chain of all the other trans@@ ac@@ tions@@ ; any modi@@ fication would alter the imp@@ rin@@ t.
If a us@@ er wanted to def@@ rau@@ d by paying twice with the same money very quickly (@@ less than ten min@@ ut@@ es), only one of the two transactions would be vali@@ dated by the network - the other would remain an or@@ ph@@ an because the two have different imp@@ rin@@ ts.
The computer that resol@@ ves the challenge wins 50 bit@@ co@@ in@@ s.
To avoid inflation, this a@@ ward is regularly divided by two@@ , probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bit@@ co@@ ins in circul@@ ation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divi@@ sible down to the hundred million@@ th, which leaves some margin@@ ...
The difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase in comp@@ uting power.
The life of the network has had its ups and down@@ s.
Web@@ sites providing services for Bit@@ co@@ in have been attacked and bit@@ co@@ ins in deposits stol@@ en.
"@@ The lo@@ op@@ hol@@ e used is not the proto@@ col itself@@ " says P@@ ier@@ re No@@ iz@@ at reass@@ ur@@ ingly, who has just launched P@@ ay@@ mi@@ um, a real currency payment company that uses the Bit@@ co@@ in net@@ work.
The ECB also highlights the possibilities of money la@@ under@@ ing using this anony@@ mous servic@@ e.
But cash also has this weak@@ ness.
Major players like Wiki@@ pedi@@ a refuse don@@ ations of this nature.
Other@@ s, such as the W@@ ord@@ Pres@@ s blo@@ g plat@@ form, accept them.
Recently, A@@ di Sh@@ am@@ ir and Dor@@ it R@@ on, from the Wei@@ z@@ mann Institute in Israel, analy@@ sed the accounting books and showed that almost 80% of bit@@ co@@ ins do not circul@@ ate.
In November, "@@ huge sell@@ -@@ off@@ s" were laun@@ ch@@ ed.
"@@ Thir@@ ty thousand dollars were exchan@@ ged@@ " wel@@ comes J@@ on Hol@@ m@@ qu@@ ist, who works for Co@@ in@@ ab@@ ul@@ , which conver@@ ts bit@@ co@@ ins to gol@@ d.
P@@ ier@@ re No@@ iz@@ at, also author of an educational book on this currency, has a lot of faith in the potential of this technology as a transaction net@@ work.
His system, P@@ ay@@ t@@ uni@@ a, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money@@ ) or a contac@@ tless payment by mo@@ bi@@ le, but it uses Bit@@ co@@ in to vali@@ date trans@@ actions, which are thus cheap@@ er.
Also the us@@ er man@@ ages his identity and can therefore be anony@@ mo@@ us.
The system is easy to implement by mer@@ chan@@ ts, who do not need to inst@@ all new termin@@ als or soft@@ war@@ e.
They just need to provide an address that a phone can "@@ photo@@ gra@@ ph and reco@@ g@@ nis@@ e" says P@@ ier@@ re No@@ iz@@ at, who con@@ firms he has thousands of us@@ ers.
There is a general movement to re@@ ap@@ pra@@ ise hierarch@@ ical systems for more horizon@@ tal systems.
"@@ It will take time for Bit@@ co@@ in to become firmly establish@@ ed, but 2013 could be a turning poin@@ t@@ ," he predic@@ ts.
The ECB, in its report, says it will re@@ assess the various risks, currently regarded as high, in the event of the currency@@ 's success.
We got out of Afghanistan.
What now@@ ?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (@@ K@@ ap@@ is@@ a and S@@ uro@@ bi@@ ).
NATO and the Americans are due to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to resume poss@@ ession of its territory and the Afghan people to choose their future, without expec@@ ting us to do every@@ thing.
It is mainly Afghan peas@@ ants that we have pun@@ ished by regarding them as terror@@ ists.
And oursel@@ ves, with our 8@@ 8 soldiers kil@@ led, plus the wo@@ un@@ ded, the ma@@ im@@ ed.
The Taliban is composed of foreign extremist@@ s, former leaders in refu@@ ge in Pakistan, but often peas@@ ants who refuse the presence of foreign armed forces, like in the time of the Sovi@@ ets.
They want to defend their tradi@@ tions, both ancient and arch@@ a@@ ic, even though they have been joined by Ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s, Pakistan@@ is, Arab@@ s, U@@ z@@ bek@@ s, Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ s.
Toler@@ ated, sometimes assist@@ ed, by local insurg@@ ents, the latter will no longer be so when Western@@ ers become more scar@@ ce.
The departure of French troops from the Ni@@ j@@ ra@@ b base, which I observed from the top of h@@ ills of al@@ mon@@ d tre@@ es plan@@ ted with French fund@@ ing, was carried out in an orderly fashi@@ on.
Con@@ vo@@ ys of tru@@ cks and arm@@ ou@@ red vehicles reached Kab@@ ul without being attack@@ ed, over@@ flow@@ n by heli@@ cop@@ ters.
There will be no wave of the Taliban in Kab@@ ul by the end of 2014.
C@@ ir@@ cum@@ st@@ ances have changed since their ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble advance between 1994 and 199@@ 6.
At that time Kab@@ ul was emp@@ ty, the country being torn apart by the struggles between different fac@@ tions.
Their takeover of the country had been perceived then as a sort of liber@@ ation, a return to safet@@ y.
Afghan@@ is paid the price of the obs@@ cur@@ anti@@ sm of these peas@@ ants by the organisation of Al-@@ Qaed@@ a, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Mu@@ jah@@ id@@ in, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are allied in the desire to keep women in an inf@@ eri@@ or position.
The main anti-@@ Soviet war leaders returned to power in 2001.
They became profit@@ e@@ ers, sei@@ zing government land to res@@ ell as building land to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge American outsourcing contrac@@ ts.
They have become discredi@@ ted@@ ; what is more, most of them did not fight themselves.
The people, as I heard in the countr@@ ysi@@ de, want a Government that is not made up of th@@ iev@@ es.
Many young people want to lea@@ ve, as those who were able to benefit from American lar@@ ges@@ se will lea@@ ve@@ : the flight of capital is consider@@ able.
The young people are ti@@ red of war and its ideologi@@ es.
They have ru@@ bbed shoul@@ ders with the modern world during their ex@@ ile in Iran or Pakistan, and appreciated the benefits.
R@@ oughly 65% of the population is less than 25@@ ; Kab@@ ul now has 5 million people, a fifth of the total population.
In tow@@ ns and cities, the state schools are ful@@ l, with girls and boys alike.
It will be necessary to provide work for those young people who no longer want to return to the obs@@ cur@@ anti@@ sm of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders.
All of them, including the armed oppon@@ ents, are partial to mobile ph@@ on@@ es; televi@@ sion, with its Turkish so@@ ap oper@@ as that show a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now pres@@ ent.
Will the authorities who command it be considered legitim@@ at@@ e?
Former comman@@ ders of the anti-@@ Soviet struggle are already thinking about restoring provincial militi@@ as, which will escape the central power.
Afghanistan, land of moun@@ tain@@ s, with strong local identi@@ ties, should be able to benefit from a certain de@@ centrali@@ s@@ ation, in the image of the Western nations, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centrali@@ sed State, with strong presidential power, aboli@@ shing the post of Prime Minister, which had existed since the 196@@ 4 Constitu@@ tion.
President Karz@@ ai does not want any foreign controls, particularly on the occasion of the elections in April 2014.
But, since the 50@@ s and already well before, his country has been dependent on foreign aid.
No industries have been re-@@ establish@@ ed, no dam@@ s are in good condi@@ tion, no major irrig@@ ation systems have been repa@@ i@@ red.
Every@@ thing is impor@@ ted@@ ; nothing is produc@@ ed, apart from fru@@ it and ve@@ get@@ ab@@ les.
The Pri@@ ority is left to private initi@@ ative.
In a country ru@@ ined by thir@@ ty years of war, government control over the infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rum@@ our was spread that Afghanistan had huge miner@@ al wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the Western@@ ers were only there to seize it.
With no energy to process the iron ore or co@@ pp@@ er on si@@ te, or means of transport to export it across the moun@@ tain@@ s, there is no min@@ ing.
The Chinese have already almost left the M@@ es A@@ yn@@ ak co@@ pp@@ er min@@ e, leaving international arch@@ a@@ e@@ ologists (@@ funded by the World Bank@@ ) to search the huge Buddh@@ ist site and remain the largest employers in the provinc@@ e.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports largely depen@@ d, to restore normal relations.
The departure of French combat troops was completed on 20 Novem@@ ber.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid@@ : girl@@ s' high school, boy@@ s' high school, French Department at the University, French Institu@@ te, cooperation in the military, leg@@ al, medical and agricultural fiel@@ ds, support to the arch@@ a@@ e@@ ological Del@@ eg@@ ation.
Since 2009, to try to "@@ win hearts and mind@@ s" and achieve the impossible task of reconc@@ iling aid and offensive actions, a "@@ civil-@@ military ac@@ tions@@ " service from the Ministry of def@@ ence (C@@ im@@ ic@@ ), closed in 2012, has carried out, and continues to carry out success@@ fully, through a small French NGO@@ , many community and agricultural rehabilit@@ ation projects in dozens of moun@@ tain vill@@ ages.
These projects, involving large numbers of local lab@@ our@@ , have helped to contain the insur@@ gen@@ cy@@ : irrig@@ ation, well@@ s, drinking water, re@@ forest@@ ation, fru@@ it tre@@ es, so@@ il protection and increase in cultiv@@ able areas.
What will we leave as a sou@@ ven@@ ir, after two billion euros of military spend@@ ing?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very hard in these val@@ le@@ ys often located over 2,000 met@@ res above sea level.
The Em@@ b@@ ass@@ y has received dozens of written requ@@ ests for small agricultural projects from local communities in K@@ ap@@ is@@ a provinc@@ e.
To be in a position to free themselves from the upri@@ sing led by foreign groups, which is what farmers told me they wan@@ t, a small amount of civil aid should be maintained in their fa@@ vo@@ ur, well controlled and directly affecting them.
A Constitution by force in Egypt
A new gam@@ ble for President Mohammed Mor@@ si.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declar@@ ation, which temporarily gran@@ ts him full powers, he has decided to go for bro@@ k@@ e.
T@@ aking everyone by surprise, he announced on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day that the Constitu@@ ent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the head of State had given the Assembly two more months to fin@@ ish its work.
For two years Egypt has relied on a provi@@ sional tex@@ t, am@@ ended several times and this has weakened institutional stability and led to legal im@@ bro@@ gli@@ os.
This new initiative has only served to enhance the divide in the country.
According to his oppon@@ ents, the President is per@@ sever@@ ing in his "@@ autocratic deli@@ ri@@ um@@ ," continuing to "@@ go back on his wor@@ d@@ " and '@@ tra@@ mp@@ le the law@@ ."
His supporters affir@@ m that this is the quick@@ est way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis, by spe@@ eding up the transition process.
A referendum is due to be held within the next two week@@ s.
A very short period, which forces the Brothers to abandon their plan to explain the tex@@ t, article by ar@@ tic@@ le, to the Egypti@@ ans.
For the Presid@@ ent, it is also a way to achieve popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute ra@@ ges throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote fa@@ v@@ oura@@ b@@ ly, as he stated in an inter@@ view with the American week@@ ly Tim@@ e.
Par@@ ticul@@ arly since a ha@@ st@@ y vote sm@@ ack@@ s of an ultim@@ at@@ um to the Egyptian peop@@ le: "@@ Either you vote for my tex@@ t, or I keep full power@@ s@@ ," these powers supposedly exp@@ iring following adoption of the Constitu@@ tion.
It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constitu@@ ent Ass@@ emb@@ ly, with a large Islamist maj@@ ority, voted on the text y@@ ester@@ day.
Most of the liberals were miss@@ ing.
In mid-@@ November, shor@@ tly before the constitutional declar@@ ation, they had s@@ lam@@ med the do@@ or, feeling they had failed to assert their view@@ s.
Represent@@ atives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done lik@@ ewi@@ se.
In order to obtain a qu@@ or@@ um, 11 members, altern@@ ates, were has@@ ti@@ ly added y@@ ester@@ day mor@@ ning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherho@@ od.
Not surprisingly, the ar@@ ticles were for the most part voted un@@ ani@@ mous@@ ly.
Com@@ ment@@ ators were also am@@ used that one of the only diver@@ sions of the day was expressed with regard to@@ ... the hour of pra@@ y@@ er, some Committee members feeling that the Constitu@@ ent Assembly clo@@ ck was wrong.
The tex@@ t, which was still being voted on y@@ ester@@ day even@@ ing, has 23@@ 4 ar@@ tic@@ les.
The main focus of atten@@ tion, article 2, remains in the final analysis iden@@ tical to that of the 197@@ 1 Constitu@@ tion, sti@@ pul@@ ating that "the principles of sh@@ aria are the main source of law@@ ."
The Salaf@@ ist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim@@ , were hoping to replace "the principl@@ es@@ " by "the rul@@ es@@ ," which would have allowed stric@@ ter applic@@ ation.
For the Islam@@ ists, the fact that this article was not am@@ ended is a guarantee of their good@@ will and their respect for the other elements of Egyptian society.
"@@ Hypo@@ cri@@ sy@@ " respond the liber@@ als, who see only a communication cou@@ p.
Because in their opinion Islam@@ is@@ ation of the Constitution is done through other ar@@ tic@@ les.
They ref@@ er in particular to article 2@@ 20, which gran@@ ts Al-@@ A@@ zh@@ ar University an advis@@ ory role, with particular reference to veri@@ fying the con@@ form@@ ity of the laws with sh@@ ari@@ a.
According to Egypt speci@@ alist S@@ op@@ h@@ ie P@@ om@@ mier@@ , this is worrying because "the people called upon to adv@@ ise are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
This suggests the beginn@@ ings of a theo@@ cra@@ cy@@ ."
The liberal@@ s' fears are also fu@@ elled by the fact that the next Rec@@ tor of the university will probably be much less moderate than the current one.
"@@ For the time bein@@ g, there is no concrete religious implic@@ ation.

In Israel, hol@@ y places awa@@ it Ukrainian touri@@ sts, the om@@ p@@ hal@@ os and a sea of sal@@ ine water
The Hol@@ y Land combin@@ es the spl@@ end@@ our of bi@@ bli@@ cal truth@@ s, modern comfort and prim@@ ev@@ al nature.
A@@ i@@ F [@@ Argument@@ i i Fak@@ ti@@ ] newspaper highlighted the five most important reasons why it is a must to visit Israel.
L@@ et@@ 's wor@@ ship the hol@@ y places
It is worth visi@@ ting the Ri@@ ver Jordan where J@@ es@@ us was b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed.
It is considered that all who enter this b@@ ap@@ tism "@@ b@@ ath@@ " are bl@@ essed by Go@@ d.
G@@ ali@@ le@@ e is the place where J@@ es@@ us performed his magi@@ c@@ : turned water into w@@ ine at a w@@ ed@@ ding, wal@@ ked on water, cal@@ med a stor@@ m, and filled the net@@ s.
This is also where J@@ es@@ us came before his discipl@@ es and after the resur@@ rec@@ tion.
But the biggest number of hol@@ y places is in Jerusal@@ em@@ .
Be@@ lie@@ vers walk through the W@@ ay of Gri@@ ef or Vi@@ a D@@ ol@@ or@@ o@@ sa@@ .
It starts by the Ant@@ onia Fort@@ ress - Pra@@ et@@ ori@@ um - where the jud@@ gement took place, and brings us along the streets of the Old T@@ own to the Church of the Hol@@ y Sep@@ ul@@ ch@@ re on Gol@@ go@@ th@@ a - the place of the cruci@@ fix@@ i@@ on, St@@ one of Un@@ c@@ tion and the place of J@@ es@@ us@@ ' bu@@ ri@@ al.
This is also the location of the symbolic Christian om@@ p@@ hal@@ os, which symboli@@ zes the sal@@ vation of man@@ kin@@ d.
The Hol@@ y Cro@@ ss Mon@@ ast@@ ery in Jerusalem is er@@ ec@@ ted at the site that, according to Christian legen@@ d, yiel@@ ded the tre@@ e used to make the cross for J@@ es@@ us@@ ' cruci@@ fix@@ i@@ on.
Jerusalem has the most hol@@ y places for the Jews as well - the W@@ ailing W@@ all, which remained from a temp@@ le destroyed by the Rom@@ ans in 70 AD@@ .
According to tradi@@ tion, people of different fai@@ ths leave no@@ tes here with their wish@@ es, which are then ful@@ fil@@ led.
Tra@@ vel along a ver@@ tical
Ru@@ ins of the Mass@@ ada Fort@@ ress remain from a secret refu@@ ge from enemi@@ es, built by Her@@ od in 25 B@@ C for his family.
They are located on cli@@ ffs in the moun@@ tains at an elev@@ ation of 4@@ 50 m above sea level.
They can be reached on fo@@ ot only by those who are into moun@@ tain clim@@ b@@ ing.
Others are delivered to this historical moun@@ tain@@ top by a c@@ able@@ way.
In the north of the country, at an elev@@ ation of 160@@ 0-@@ 20@@ 40 m, there is a famous ski resort called Her@@ mon@@ , which fill@@ s up with touri@@ sts in win@@ ter months.
A shut@@ tle bus brings people to it from the fo@@ ot of the moun@@ tain@@ .
The total leng@@ th of ski p@@ ist@@ es is 45 k@@ m.
According to an ancient legen@@ d, pag@@ an go@@ ds used to live on the moun@@ tain@@ .
Vi@@ sit unique mus@@ e@@ ums
This country has about 300 mus@@ e@@ ums.
You won@@ 't be able to visit all of them on one trip
But at least the five most interesting ones are worth a visi@@ t.
Among them - Mus@@ eum of Israel, located close to Kn@@ es@@ set (@@ Parliament@@ ).
It has ancient Q@@ um@@ ran man@@ us@@ crip@@ ts and De@@ ad Sea sc@@ roll@@ s found in the ca@@ ves of the Ju@@ de@@ an des@@ ert, along with about 500@@ ,000 arch@@ a@@ e@@ ological and anthrop@@ ological ar@@ te@@ fac@@ ts.
The Mus@@ eum of Art in Tel@@ -@@ Avi@@ v is also interest@@ ing.
Its exhi@@ bits include a wide range of impres@@ sion@@ ists and expres@@ sion@@ ists like Mon@@ et, P@@ is@@ sar@@ ro@@ , Ren@@ o@@ ir, S@@ is@@ le@@ y, C@@ ez@@ an@@ ne, M@@ atis@@ se, Mo@@ dig@@ li@@ ani, Cha@@ g@@ all, P@@ ic@@ as@@ so.
In Ak@@ ko, you can visit the b@@ ath mus@@ eum Al-@@ Bas@@ ha@@ , which consists of several ro@@ oms of ancient Turkish b@@ ath@@ s with models of visi@@ tors and b@@ ath atten@@ dan@@ ts of the time.
In Ca@@ es@@ area, it is worth visi@@ ting the unique private R@@ all@@ i Mus@@ e@@ um, where you can enjoy the s@@ cul@@ p@@ tures of D@@ ali and Ro@@ d@@ in.
There are no t@@ our gu@@ i@@ des or gi@@ ft sh@@ op@@ s.
En@@ try is free of char@@ ge, and contributions are strictly not allow@@ ed.
The fifth one is the Holocaust Mus@@ eum or Y@@ ad V@@ ash@@ em in Tel@@ -@@ Avi@@ v, which tells one of the most dramatic stories in history.
The most tragic sec@@ tion is the children@@ 's mem@@ ori@@ al, built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas ch@@ am@@ ber@@ s.
You go in and find your@@ self in complete dark@@ ness.
St@@ ars are g@@ lim@@ mer@@ ing,
and you listen to names of Jewish children and countries where they di@@ ed.
Ukraine is mentioned there too.
W@@ ell@@ ness
There are three resort areas in Israel, located on the coast@@ s of the Mediterran@@ e@@ an, R@@ ed, and De@@ ad S@@ eas@@ .
Each have swi@@ mm@@ ing pool@@ s, a@@ qu@@ a par@@ ks, dol@@ p@@ hin@@ aria and oce@@ an@@ ari@@ a.
It is notable that one can swi@@ m in the Red Sea even in win@@ ter months, because the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air war@@ ms to 23 degre@@ es.
The De@@ ad Sea is even warm@@ er, and people swi@@ m in it all year round@@ .
In@@ cid@@ ent@@ ally, it is the most unusual sea in the world, located in the lowest point of the planet - 4@@ 17 m below sea level.
Its az@@ ure water is sal@@ ine and easily keeps you af@@ lo@@ at, even if you don't know how to swi@@ m.
The surrounding landscap@@ es are sur@@ real in their beau@@ ty.
People come here to under@@ go a course of treatment using sal@@ t water - w@@ rap@@ s and medic@@ in@@ al mu@@ ds, and to improve their health if they have der@@ mati@@ ti@@ s, all@@ ergi@@ es, as@@ th@@ mas@@ , ec@@ z@@ em@@ as, ar@@ thri@@ ti@@ s, b@@ ron@@ chi@@ ti@@ s, or di@@ abet@@ es, or to return emotional balance.
Tou@@ ch the my@@ steri@@ es of anti@@ qu@@ ity
They are preser@@ ved in the old sec@@ tion of Tel@@ -@@ Avi@@ v - in the town of J@@ aff@@ a on the Mediterranean Se@@ a.
The famous sea route connec@@ ting Egypt, Syria, An@@ at@@ oli@@ a, and Mes@@ o@@ po@@ tam@@ ia runs through it.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian le@@ gend@@ s.
According to le@@ gend@@ s, this is where No@@ ah built his ark and Per@@ se@@ us saved the beau@@ ty An@@ dro@@ med@@ a, with whom he lived a long and happy life.
Touri@@ sts really like to w@@ ander the narrow streets named after signs of the zo@@ di@@ ac@@ .
They say, if you touch the walls on the street of your sig@@ n, fortun@@ e will come to you@@ .
In J@@ aff@@ a, you can meet new@@ ly@@ w@@ eds who come from all over Israel and even from other countries for pho@@ to s@@ ession@@ s.
And in Ca@@ es@@ area - the city of King Her@@ od - you can walk around a Roman the@@ at@@ re, "@@ cap@@ ture@@ " the C@@ rus@@ ader fort@@ res@@ s.
During the Roman period, Ca@@ es@@ area was the main city of Ju@@ de@@ a and the residen@@ ce of Roman pre@@ f@@ ec@@ ts, including P@@ on@@ ti@@ us Pil@@ ate.
The carefully restored the@@ at@@ re is now used for ev@@ ening concer@@ ts and oper@@ a performan@@ c@@ es.
A note for the touri@@ st
When you go to Israel, don't worry about your bad English knowled@@ ge: approximately 30% of the country's population speaks Russi@@ an.
For the tri@@ p, it is better to take dollars, not euro@@ s, because they are easily ex@@ changed for sh@@ ek@@ els (@@ currently 1 dollar = 3.@@ 8 sh@@ ek@@ el@@ s).
City transportation is mainly bus@@ es, but Jerusalem has a high-@@ speed tra@@ m, and Hai@@ f@@ a has the only sub@@ way line in the country, compri@@ sing six st@@ ops and connec@@ ting upper town with lower@@ .
In essen@@ ce, it is an underground c@@ able rail@@ way.
A tick@@ et for any type of city transportation costs 6 sh@@ ek@@ els, and you can ri@@ de for 1.5 hours with transfer@@ s.
According to the Jewish tradi@@ tion, S@@ ab@@ b@@ ath is celeb@@ rated in Israel.
Between Fri@@ day ev@@ ening and the sun@@ set on Sat@@ ur@@ day, markets, stor@@ es, and public transportation stop work@@ ing.
The work week starts on Sun@@ day mor@@ ning.
Many c@@ af@@ es, restau@@ rants and ho@@ tels have only ko@@ sh@@ er food, with no por@@ k, se@@ af@@ o@@ od, fish with no scal@@ es, or dish@@ es that combine mil@@ k with me@@ at.
There is a wide selection of dish@@ es from lam@@ b and be@@ ef, sou@@ ps and des@@ ser@@ ts co@@ oked using co@@ con@@ ut mil@@ k, traditional Jewish hum@@ mus pa@@ ste, various sau@@ c@@ es, fal@@ af@@ el (@@ ball@@ s made of ground chick@@ peas@@ ), fru@@ its and ve@@ get@@ ab@@ les.
The streets of Israel don't have hom@@ eless dog@@ s.
But there are many well-@@ fed cat@@ s, which walk around la@@ z@@ ily.
In the even@@ ing, they can even be seen sle@@ eping on ro@@ of@@ s of par@@ ked car@@ s.
These pus@@ sy@@ c@@ ats like busy places and do not refuse treat@@ s.
C@@ ar rent@@ al, depending on car typ@@ e, costs from 37 (@@ Hy@@ un@@ da@@ i G@@ etz@@ ) to 18@@ 8 (@@ Au@@ di A@@ 6, Vol@@ vo S@@ 80@@ ) dollars a day.
Pl@@ us insurance of 15 dollars a day.
Bi@@ ke r@@ ental costs 15 sh@@ ek@@ els a day.
Mus@@ eum ent@@ ran@@ ce costs 30 sh@@ ek@@ els on average.
In numbers
In 2012, over three million touri@@ sts from around the world visited Israel.
Visi@@ tors and holi@@ day@@ makers arri@@ ve mostly from the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, and Ukraine.
Between January and October 2012 1@@ 18@@ ,@@ 800 Ukrainian touri@@ sts visited the Hol@@ y Land, which is 5@@ 1% more than a similar figure in 2010, before the removal of the vis@@ a regime on February 9, 2011.
Only the "@@ high and migh@@ ty@@ " make it to Mosco@@ w@@ : migrants save money for language
While dep@@ u@@ ties and human rights activists argue about the purpose of the law on mandatory language test@@ ing, the country already has sc@@ am arti@@ sts who sell f@@ ake cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Mosco@@ w, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Mo@@ st@@ ly these are citizens of Central Asi@@ a: U@@ z@@ bek@@ ist@@ an, Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ istan and Turkmen@@ ist@@ an.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families back home.
A new law came into effect on December 1, which oblig@@ es every migrant worker to pass a Russian language tes@@ t.
For the moment, this law applies only to those who inten@@ d to work in services, housing and utili@@ ty services, household services, and re@@ tail@@ .
But with time - as promised by the Federal Migration Service - tests will become mandatory for all non-@@ resid@@ ents.
In addition to language, Russian history and basi@@ cs of the legal system will be tes@@ ted.
Lang@@ u@@ age knowledge will have to be confirmed both to receive and to extend the work per@@ mit@@ .
An exception is in effect only for citizens of countries where Russian is a state langu@@ age.
People who received education cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates and diplom@@ as before the fall of the USS@@ R in 1991 are also exemp@@ t under the law.
P@@ ur@@ po@@ se, doomed f@@ ate, and the protection of rights
S@@ even testing points will be operating under the au@@ spic@@ es of the P@@ ush@@ kin Institute of Russian Lang@@ u@@ age, Peop@@ les@@ ' Fri@@ end@@ ship University of Russia, Moscow State University (M@@ G@@ U@@ ), St. Petersburg State University (S@@ P@@ b@@ G@@ U@@ ), and other Russian education institutions.
Mig@@ rants can take the tests in all citi@@ es; more than 1@@ 60 such cent@@ res have been open@@ ed.
The initiative to introduce the testing was supported by State Duma members and the Federal Migration Ser@@ vic@@ es.
But human rights activi@@ sts, asked the question repeatedly in the press before the law came into forc@@ e: what will it actually achiev@@ e?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for the Russians and for the non-@@ resid@@ ent@@ s?
First of all, according to representatives of the migration service, this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from lab@@ our sla@@ ver@@ y.
Many speak about protection of the rights of work migran@@ ts, explains the He@@ ad of the representative office of the Federal Migration Services of Russia, Viktor Seb@@ elev@@ .
Rights protection should begin before their depar@@ ture.
Only the system of organized selection will enable us to solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Mig@@ rants without profession@@ , education, who do not know Russi@@ an, who do not have a medical cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate start to have problems.
If a migrant does not understand the language, says Seb@@ el@@ ev with certain@@ ty, he is doomed to come across un@@ con@@ scienti@@ ous people, who, preten@@ ding to help, will force upon him a "@@ tick@@ et@@ " to terri@@ ble, cra@@ mp@@ ed bar@@ ra@@ cks where many others like him will suffer without food and docum@@ ents, sla@@ ving away 1@@ 2-@@ 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migran@@ ts.
"@@ They are promised one thing at home, but when they arri@@ ve, they are lied to, their pas@@ sports are tak@@ en, they are not paid what they were promis@@ ed@@ ," con@@ firms the He@@ ad of the Ma@@ in Mig@@ rant Labour Administration of the Migration Service of Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ istan To@@ li@@ b Shari@@ po@@ v.
Not be ang@@ ry, boss@@ !
Nonetheless, many citizens of Central Asian countries, who plan to go to work in Russia, admit that not only their understanding of the language of the country where they are going is not good, but they can barely write in their own langu@@ age.
Natur@@ ally, this is not so much their faul@@ t, but due to pover@@ ty@@ : very few Turk@@ s, U@@ z@@ bek@@ s, and Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ s can afford even a basic education.
Their families don't even have food to feed their children, not to mention decent clo@@ thing, sho@@ es, and suppli@@ es.
After reaching ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ence, these ki@@ ds go to work at the first opportunity.
It is har@@ d, if language knowledge is b@@ ad, they ad@@ mit@@ .
"@@ You feel humili@@ ated and inf@@ eri@@ or@@ ."
But human rights activists note one important point about the law on langu@@ age.
Test@@ ing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
If they have no status, there will be no test@@ ing, nor any official work in the future.
In the meantime, most of the migrant workers continue to live in Russia illeg@@ ally.
"@@ Wel@@ come, or No Un@@ authori@@ zed En@@ tr@@ y"
Many of the foreigners assert that receiving official status in our country is not that easy.
The reason lies in bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and the already mentioned language difficul@@ ties.
In addition, leg@@ alization costs money@@ : from 12@@ ,000 to 16@@ ,000 ru@@ bl@@ es.
Whereas a f@@ ake regi@@ stration is done quickly and costs only one and a half thous@@ and.
Off@@ ic@@ ers of the Russian Poli@@ ce know that we mainly have f@@ ake pap@@ ers, without regi@@ stra@@ tion, hence the ex@@ tor@@ tion.
"@@ They ask for a hundred or two for ci@@ gar@@ ett@@ es, te@@ a@@ ," Um@@ ed Kh@@ ush@@ k@@ ad@@ am@@ ov@@ , a citizen of Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ ist@@ an, shared with journ@@ alists.
"@@ Rol@@ l up, don't be cheap@@ , get your ar@@ t@@ work@@ "
On the first day of the law@@ 's entry into effect it turned out that not only migrant regi@@ stration documents can be fak@@ e.
A few for@@ ged cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates about passing language tests have been seized by Federal Migration Services officers alread@@ y.
For@@ ged documents are prin@@ ted on a standard col@@ our pr@@ inter@@ .
Natur@@ ally, they were not free for their owner@@ s: each of the migran@@ ts, who had hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests in this way paid seven thousand ru@@ bles for them.
It is two and a half times more than the process of official test@@ ing, which costs three thous@@ and.
Government officials and human rights activists agree that the main goal in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates could not just be b@@ ough@@ t.
For the moment, the authorities can promise migrant workers who could not pass the test the first time to give time to complete a basic language course.
In addition, those who come without Russian language knowledge will be offered work in areas that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Inter@@ ior does not put arms from the illegal market back into circul@@ ation
The share of crime involving legal weapons is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Inter@@ ior is proposing to tough@@ en up the law for owners of civil weapons.
This is the reaction of authorities to recent inci@@ dent@@ s: C@@ L@@ IC@@ K sho@@ ts at w@@ ed@@ d@@ ings, where there were no casual@@ ties, and the massacre st@@ aged by Moscow lawy@@ er Dmit@@ ry V@@ ino@@ gra@@ do@@ v, resulting in C@@ L@@ IC@@ K the death of seven people.
Poli@@ c@@ emen want to prohi@@ bit the carrying of weapons in public places and raise the legal age of weapons lic@@ ens@@ ing from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Saf@@ ety and Anti-@@ Cor@@ rup@@ tion, I@@ rin@@ a Y@@ aro@@ v@@ ay@@ a, who promised that the amend@@ ments to the law on weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by "@@ tightening the scre@@ w@@ s@@ ."
An open letter appeared on@@ line, whose auth@@ ors - representatives of different social ri@@ f@@ le organizations - demand to abandon the "@@ sen@@ sel@@ ess tough@@ en@@ ing@@ ."
The percentage of crime involving regi@@ stered weapons is minim@@ al, said criminal lawy@@ er V@@ asi@@ ly Les@@ ni@@ ko@@ v to BB@@ C Russia.
According to the Ministry of the Inter@@ ior@@ 's statisti@@ cs, 14@@ 2 crimes using fire@@ arms regi@@ stered with law enforcement agencies have been committed in the six months of 2012, whereas 1,@@ 16@@ 8@@ ,000 crimes have been recorded in total for this period.
Auth@@ ors of the open letter are certain that the tough@@ ening of the law in the area of civil weapons will not prevent the criminal from going to the "@@ black@@ " market.
According to them, one can find any weapon at a low price right now.
Nonetheless, the Ministry of the Inter@@ ior asser@@ ts that the situation of the spread of illegal arms is under control.
Sup@@ p@@ lier@@ s: from plants to officers
The "@@ black@@ " market of weapons is re@@ pl@@ en@@ ished through several chann@@ el@@ s.
There are five such chann@@ els, explains reti@@ red colon@@ el Viktor Bar@@ an@@ ets, who has worked in the Ministry of Education and the General St@@ af@@ f for 10 years.
S@@ cre@@ en@@ shot of the site that accep@@ ts orders for weapons.
Fir@@ st: "@@ army or military lo@@ ot@@ ," i.@@ e. weapons that were stol@@ en during the fighting in the Caucas@@ us.
"@@ We@@ ap@@ ons were stol@@ en by Russian officers and by the Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans@@ ," says Bar@@ an@@ ets.
Next are "@@ black weapon@@ s@@ ," stol@@ en by criminals from representatives of def@@ ence agen@@ cies.
Bar@@ an@@ ets explains that this cover@@ s weapons taken from police war@@ eh@@ ous@@ es and those stol@@ en directly from law enforcement agen@@ ci@@ es' employe@@ es.
Il@@ legal arms are taken to be sold from military war@@ eh@@ ous@@ es.
Explo@@ sions have often been heard at military war@@ eh@@ ous@@ es.
"@@ There are proven theories that some of the fi@@ res were inten@@ tion@@ al, in order to cover the shor@@ ta@@ ge@@ ," says the former military man.
Man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ers of weapons make their contribu@@ tion, according to Bar@@ an@@ ets.
"@@ There are so many private weapons factories now, which do not endur@@ e competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the counter to the black market, including in Mosco@@ w@@ ," says the exper@@ t.
Another source of the "@@ black@@ " market is traffick@@ ing.
An especially high number of g@@ uns and machine g@@ uns come from poor countries like Ky@@ r@@ gy@@ z@@ st@@ an.
"@@ Ther@@ e's production there, sometimes hand@@ ma@@ de@@ ; and a ma@@ fi@@ a has form@@ ed, which has organized a stream@@ ," explains the former military man.
Where do the weapons come fro@@ m@@ ?
Exper@@ ts counted the approxim@@ ate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "@@ black@@ " market.
A report about this was prepared by the Cent@@ re of Problems Analy@@ sis and Public Management Pl@@ ann@@ ing in 2011.
Exper@@ ts analy@@ sed the reports of the Department of the Inter@@ ior and Ros@@ stat@@ , crimin@@ ology literat@@ ure and open data from port@@ als on weapons.
The overwhelming majority of illegal weapons, according to the resear@@ ch@@ ers, comes from the military and security forces.
Hal@@ f of all arms on the black market are there "@@ because of officials, whose work is connected with weapon@@ s@@ ," states the repor@@ t.
According to resear@@ cher@@ s' data, 17% of the time the weapons are received from armed conflict areas, 14% is th@@ eft during production, 5% is "@@ black arch@@ a@@ e@@ olog@@ y@@ ."
A sales consult@@ ant of one of the weapons stor@@ es, who wi@@ shed to remain anony@@ mo@@ us, asser@@ ts that the weapons found by "@@ black@@ " dig@@ gers are not being bought any more, because the@@ y@@ '@@ re too ol@@ d.
According to him, deal@@ ers go to the military war@@ eh@@ ous@@ e for a new bat@@ ch of goods.
One piec@@ e, for example a T@@ T gun can be bought from a war@@ rant offic@@ er.
It is issued to him, and given through the f@@ ence.
"@@ He takes it to the city and s@@ ells for 900 euros a piece with two maga@@ z@@ ines@@ ," he say@@ s.
"@@ The truth is that police are aware of every@@ thing, that is why perio@@ dic@@ ally, when the crime detec@@ tion rate is low, it conduc@@ ts test purchases from illegal weapons mer@@ chan@@ ts@@ ," says the consul@@ tan@@ t.
"@@ Like in a luxury st@@ ore@@ "
The buy@@ er and s@@ eller often find each other through friend@@ s.
I looked at si@@ tes, blo@@ gs, ti@@ ll someone respon@@ ded, offering me to go to Be@@ go@@ v@@ aya st@@ ation, where a man will be waiting for me to take me to the "@@ cor@@ ner@@ " so we can negoti@@ ate.
I found out the price of the weapon only there
military comment@@ ator Viktor Bar@@ an@@ ets
To get a weap@@ on, I need someone with connec@@ tions, says the sales consul@@ tan@@ t. - I have an acqu@@ ain@@ t@@ ance, but I@@ '@@ m not sure it@@ 's reli@@ able.
There are sal@@ es@@ men on lab@@ our markets, but one needs to "@@ com@@ e" there condi@@ tionally "@@ from John Do@@ e, who asked to tell that his daugh@@ ter lost a too@@ th@@ ."
Right now, even if I need a few k@@ nu@@ ck@@ le@@ du@@ ster@@ s, I get them through someone I tru@@ st.
He also supplies them only to me, because he knows that I won@@ 't give him away.
Beg@@ inn@@ ers look for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Viktor Bar@@ an@@ ets tried himself as a buy@@ er of illegal weapons in the mid-@@ 1990@@ 's, when he was preparing to publi@@ sh an article about this.
The formul@@ as are still the sam@@ e, according to him.
He was given an al@@ b@@ um of pic@@ tures with "@@ anything and every@@ th@@ ing@@ ."
"@@ I felt like I was in a luxury st@@ ore@@ ," he rec@@ all@@ s.
According to Bar@@ an@@ ets, the buy@@ er is not offered a p@@ ig in a po@@ ke - you can try out every@@ thing.
I, the potential cli@@ ent, am not just buy@@ ing; we go to the forest with the s@@ eller and set a target there.
"@@ I am given the opportunity to shoo@@ t, and when I am certain that the weapon is good, we begin to negoti@@ ate@@ ," describes the exper@@ t.

In the last few days, there is a wave of protest actions in the U@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ A. against low salaries in super@@ markets of the Wal@@ mar@@ t chain and popular fast food chain restau@@ rants like Mc@@ Don@@ al@@ d@@ 's, Bur@@ ger K@@ ing, T@@ ac@@ o B@@ ell, Wen@@ dy@@ 's and K@@ ent@@ u@@ ck@@ y Fri@@ ed Ch@@ ick@@ en.
Right now, nobody is able to predict whether this wave will turn into the n@@ in@@ th wave or it is dest@@ ined to fiz@@ z@@ le out ear@@ ly.
Ac@@ tions are being supported by unions and a series of left-wing organizations.
In addition to increasing the low wages received by employees of Wal@@ mar@@ t and fast food chain@@ s, the goal of the protesters is to create unions within them.
This sector of the economy is not covered by any union movement y@@ et.
4@@ 6 cents a year@@ ?
Ac@@ tions began last week after Th@@ ank@@ s@@ gi@@ ving, on Black Fri@@ day, when massive sales drew millions of people in America, sometimes accompanied by clas@@ h@@ es.
On this day, some employees of the Wal@@ mar@@ t corpor@@ ation, which emp@@ lo@@ ys 2.@@ 2 million people around the world, left their work@@ places and pi@@ ck@@ eted together with the unions and left-wing activists from the corpor@@ ation stor@@ es that sell products to people on low-@@ to-@@ medium incom@@ es.
Wal@@ mar@@ t s@@ ells everything imagin@@ able, from di@@ ap@@ ers, h@@ unting ri@@ fl@@ es and car bat@@ teri@@ es, to vacuum clean@@ ers, eg@@ gs and mil@@ k.
Pro@@ duc@@ ts in its stor@@ es are on average 8% to 2@@ 7% cheaper than in major super@@ markets.
So many low-@@ paid Wal@@ mar@@ t employees sho@@ p only at their work@@ place.
A@@ v@@ ail@@ ability and ass@@ or@@ tment made Wal@@ mar@@ t one of the biggest American corpor@@ ations.
According to critic@@ s, Wal@@ mar@@ t can afford to sell the products cheap@@ ly partly because it pays little to its employe@@ es.
These latter also complain about hard work conditions, for example lack of lift tru@@ cks and hand@@ -@@ held sc@@ ann@@ ers.
Protes@@ ters on Black Fri@@ day demanded a sal@@ ary increase and complained that the cost of medical insurance provided by the corpor@@ ation went from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Wal@@ mar@@ t employe@@ e, receiving 9.@@ 5 dollar@@ s@@ /@@ ho@@ ur, cannot afford this.
Scienti@@ sts from the Ber@@ kel@@ ey University in California argue that if Wal@@ mar@@ t raises the average sal@@ ary to 12 dollar@@ s@@ /@@ ho@@ ur, it will cost the corpor@@ ation 3.@@ 2 billion dollars.
This is about 1.@@ 1% more than it spends on salaries right now.
If Wal@@ mar@@ t fully shifts the cost of increasing wages to the shoul@@ ders of consumers, each visit to the store will cost only 4@@ 6 cents more.
In one year, they will only spend 1@@ 2.@@ 39 dollars more than now.
Wal@@ mar@@ t supporters happ@@ ily note that the protests took place in nine states and did not cause any damage at all to the corpor@@ ation.
Black Fri@@ day continued in its stor@@ es from 8 in the ev@@ ening on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day ti@@ ll mid@@ night the next day, and during the period Wal@@ mar@@ t sold about 5@@ 000 products a secon@@ d.
In tot@@ al, its cash regi@@ sters conducted nearly 100 million transactions on Black Fri@@ day.
Represent@@ ative of the corpor@@ ation, Dan Fo@@ gel@@ man, asser@@ ted in an inter@@ view with a left-wing si@@ te, the Hu@@ ff@@ ing@@ ton Po@@ st, that a total of "@@ less than fi@@ ve@@ " Wal@@ mar@@ t employees left the work@@ place, and the protest act was just "@@ another P@@ R trick@@ " of the union that organized it.
"@@ Free cash regi@@ ster@@ !@@ "
Pro@@ tests continued this week in New York, where their object was not Wal@@ mar@@ t (@@ the@@ y@@ '@@ re not so welcome in the progressive city, that is why they don't exist here y@@ et@@ ), but Mc@@ Don@@ al@@ d@@ 's and other cheap restau@@ ran@@ ts.
Mc@@ Don@@ al@@ d@@ 's says that it s@@ ells billions of por@@ tions, and despite this it does@@ n't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work@@ !
Ju@@ ma@@ ane Willi@@ am@@ s, member of the City Council of New York
At the moment, the minimum sal@@ ary according to federal and N@@ Y law is 7.@@ 25 dollars an hour@@ .
Fast food restau@@ rants increase it with time, but very litt@@ le. On average their ordinary employees in New York earn 8.@@ 90 dollar@@ s@@ /@@ hour@@ .
No@@ body ear@@ ns less in this expensive c@@ ity.
I cannot understand how one can survive in New York on this money.
Once upon a time, almost a fourth of American te@@ enag@@ ers went through Mc@@ Don@@ al@@ d@@ 's, working par@@ t-@@ time after school, living with par@@ ents.
Few saw this as a source of living or planned to stay there for long.
Now I continu@@ ously come across inter@@ views with Mc@@ Don@@ al@@ d@@ 's employe@@ es, who complain that they have to survive on this sal@@ ary and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a com@@ ment on the Wall Street Journal for@@ um, whose author no@@ tes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how you will feed them.
Parti@@ cip@@ ants of the protest that began at 6.@@ 30 a@@ .@@ m. on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day near the Mc@@ Don@@ al@@ d@@ 's on 40@@ th street and Ma@@ dis@@ on A@@ ven@@ ue demanded that cas@@ hi@@ ers and co@@ ok@@ s of the fast food chain be paid at least 15 dollar@@ s@@ /@@ ho@@ ur, i.@@ e. more than double their present wages.
They also demanded the creation of unions in the fast food industry.
American law prohi@@ bits the administration from preventing this or pun@@ ishing activists of the union movement by n@@ ag@@ ging or fir@@ ing.
On the other hand, the administration does not often ease their life.
But for objective reasons it is hard to cover fast food with a union.
One of them is the unusual turno@@ ver of employe@@ es.
Dis@@ agreeing
No@@ is@@ y protests began on this day in a number of other cheap restau@@ rants in Man@@ hat@@ t@@ an.
The highlight of the action was the after@@ no@@ on meeting near Mc@@ Don@@ al@@ d@@ 's by Times S@@ quar@@ e, where several local democratic politicians spoke out. One of them, Ju@@ ma@@ ane Willi@@ am@@ s, sa@@ id@@ : "@@ Mc@@ Don@@ al@@ d@@ 's claims it s@@ ells billions of por@@ tions, and despite this it does@@ n't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work@@ !@@ "
Demon@@ strat@@ ors were supported by other prominent N@@ Y demo@@ crats, like Bill de Bla@@ si@@ o, a candidate for N@@ Y city may@@ or, who sa@@ id@@ : "@@ We need to voice our joint support for the fast food employe@@ es, so that they can achieve fair wages and economic well@@ bein@@ g, which every New Yorker deser@@ ves@@ !@@ ."
According to the New York Tim@@ es, this was the biggest action of this kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people took part in it, and many of them were not fast food employe@@ es, which comprise tens of thousands of people in New Yor@@ k.
It is un@@ clear right now whether this will spar@@ k a mass movement.
"@@ At the moment, the mind cannot be dec@@ ei@@ ved too well@@ "
Among modern technology f@@ ans a popular top@@ ic is aug@@ ment@@ ed reality, lat@@ ely seen primarily through the pri@@ sm of special g@@ lass@@ es.
At first, a functional model was shown by Google in the summer, at its annual confer@@ ence. Then, in November, it was announced that Microsoft fil@@ ed an application for patent too.
However, according to the convers@@ ation with the leader of the group of inter@@ active 3@@ D technologies in the Cam@@ bridge labor@@ atory of Micro@@ so@@ ft, Sh@@ ah@@ ra@@ m I@@ z@@ adi@@ , g@@ lass@@ es are a thing of the past for scientists in this compan@@ y.
They are drawn by the prospect of manipul@@ ating virtual objec@@ ts in the air with bare hand@@ s, creating virtual open spac@@ es.
- P@@ le@@ ase tell us, in simple terms, about the work your research group does.
- We work on the inter@@ action of people with mach@@ ines, at the same time trying to expand the boundaries of this inter@@ action.
While people in general are stuck at working with pi@@ x@@ els on a flat scre@@ en and sometimes pointing f@@ ing@@ ers at them.
We want to look 5-@@ 10 years into the future and predict car@@ din@@ al changes in this inter@@ action.
For example, X@@ box and Kin@@ ect sen@@ sor@@ s are a step forward. Almost no X@@ box is sold without Kin@@ ect today, because everyone likes control by gest@@ ures.
- What else awa@@ its us in the future@@ ?
- Despite the fact that Kin@@ ect shifted the inter@@ action to the physical level, much still occurs on a flat scre@@ en, sometimes in 3@@ D.
Information entry has improved (the system receives more dat@@ a), but output still needs to get better.
We are trying to change this, working on truly three-@@ dimen@@ sional display systems based on various technologies, including projec@@ tion technologies.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more tan@@ gi@@ ble.
But for this, we need to identify both the us@@ er and the space around him.
Then we will be able to supp@@ lement the real world with virtual objec@@ ts in a much more convenient form.
Above all, get rid of these stup@@ id virtual reality hel@@ met@@ s@@ !
- What do you think about voice control@@ ?
It@@ 's a popular thing, but is it over@@ estim@@ at@@ ed?
- It clearly cannot be called a cu@@ re-@@ for-@@ all - there@@ 's a question of priv@@ acy, because we do not always want to let the others know about our actions and inten@@ tions.
In reality, all types of inter@@ action with computers are good, but each in their own nich@@ e.
For example, we had a project to control de@@ vices in public places, in which we thought about movem@@ ents, not wide movem@@ ents, but small, reser@@ ved ones.
Mo@@ vem@@ ents were not recorded by a cam@@ era, but by a hand bra@@ cel@@ et that determined the movement of b@@ ones and mus@@ cl@@ es.
It@@ 's big right now, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a hand wat@@ ch.
In general, the future lies in the mixed control, e.@@ g. movement + voic@@ e.
- What do you mean@@ ?
- For example, how would you ask me to give you this bott@@ le of water@@ ?
You will talk and show at the same time.
- U@@ su@@ ally I just sa@@ y.
- O@@ h, that will be very hard to detec@@ t.
- So you want to make the users adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at that moment@@ ?
- Not necess@@ ar@@ ily, but it is a mutual approxim@@ ation.
I think in the near future, we will mainly work on developing new sen@@ sor@@ s that will enable more precise determination of a person@@ 's reac@@ tion.
This could be, e.@@ g. las@@ er sen@@ sor@@ s. They have a decent depth resolu@@ tion, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with X@@ box Kin@@ ect sen@@ sor@@ s, what are your complaints about modern cam@@ er@@ as@@ ?
Not enough resolu@@ tion, depth or something else@@ ?
- In general, the current generation is what we can base ourselves on in working on three-@@ dimen@@ sional recogni@@ tion.
Of course, it would be good to have eight me@@ ga pi@@ x@@ els with 1000 k@@ /@@ s spe@@ ed.
It@@ 's not just the me@@ ga pi@@ x@@ els, though, but the quality of the mat@@ ri@@ x and the dep@@ th.
From the latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the al@@ gori@@ th@@ m desig@@ ner@@ s.
So it@@ 's important to remember about the resolution on the X@@ , Y@@ , but also the Z ax@@ is.
Spe@@ ed, the number of images per second, is also very important.
Human movements are relatively dynam@@ ic, and the current 30 k@@ /@@ s is really not enough, especially for gest@@ ures.
Ste@@ ven B@@ ath@@ ich@@ e from our Red@@ mon@@ d labor@@ atory created a touch sens@@ or with a regulated processing delay from 1 to 100 ms, while modern seri@@ al sen@@ sor@@ s are closer to the latter indicator (@@ 60@@ -@@ 100@@ ).
Not everyone understands how this affects the inter@@ action between man and mach@@ ine.
In my work, it would be very useful to have a de@@ vice that does not require tou@@ ching and would have more images per secon@@ d.
- Does the number of cam@@ er@@ as need to be increas@@ ed?
- In Kin@@ ect there are three cam@@ er@@ as now, one of which is actually an inf@@ rar@@ ed emit@@ ter and the second one, the recipient of the sign@@ al.
The third one is actually a regular sens@@ or of visible ran@@ ge.
It is not applied to determine the objec@@ t@@ 's dep@@ th.
Poten@@ ti@@ ally, a large number of cam@@ er@@ as could solve the problem@@ ...
Or make it worse, by increasing the required volume of calcul@@ ations.
It would be ni@@ ce to create a flexible analo@@ gue Kin@@ ec@@ t, play with the flexi@@ on of cam@@ era dis@@ position and see how this will help in three-@@ dimen@@ sional determination of the position.
- As far as I remember@@ , Microsoft did not present its g@@ lass@@ es to the public, unlike Goog@@ le.
Don@@ 't you think this is one of the most promising platforms from the point of view the everyday use of aug@@ ment@@ ed reality technologi@@ es?
- Certain@@ ly it is not very convenient to walk around with a smart phone in your raised hands all the time, but I think that the cool@@ est option would be "@@ transi@@ tion@@ al@@ " aug@@ ment@@ ed reality, where you could shift from g@@ lass@@ es to smart ph@@ one, projec@@ tion disp@@ la@@ y, and everywhere else based on a clo@@ ud plat@@ form.
G@@ lass@@ es are a very personal devic@@ e, that is their strength (@@ private things are seen only by you@@ ) and, at the same time, their weakness - aug@@ ment@@ ed reality based on g@@ lass@@ es will not allow you to work on virtual objec@@ ts together with other people.
- Let us imagine for a min@@ ute that manipulation of virtual h@@ olo@@ graph@@ ic objec@@ ts in the air is available not only to Tony Star@@ k from Iron@@ man, but to a regular person@@ .
There is one problem with this idea that the critics often point out@@ : no tac@@ tile feed@@ back@@ !
H@@ ands feel no@@ th@@ ing@@ !
What answers does your group prepare to this challen@@ ge@@ ?
- In my lec@@ tures I often say that aug@@ ment@@ ed reality is the sevent@@ h con@@ secu@@ tive attempt at the inter@@ action between man and mach@@ ine.
I think that the eigh@@ th will probably be the addition of tac@@ tile sens@@ ations.
For now, one of the interesting tri@@ cks is to use the second hand as a sort of mat@@ ri@@ x for the ima@@ ge.
It is great at regi@@ stering push@@ es@@ !
But there are technologies that are really aimed at giving these "@@ images in the air@@ " a sense of tan@@ gi@@ bility, for example, the interference of several targeted ul@@ tra@@ sound ra@@ ys in a specific point where the f@@ inger is located gives a sens@@ ation, but very weak right now, as if someone ble@@ w on your f@@ ing@@ er@@ ti@@ p.
There are also wri@@ st bra@@ cel@@ ets that affect the ner@@ ve end@@ ings in f@@ ing@@ ers, which is also a promising area.
- Ha@@ ve you tried to dec@@ ei@@ ve the mind@@ ?
To force it to think that it feels something that it should be feeling when it sees someth@@ ing?
- This is a good idea and we ha@@ ven@@ 't tried this y@@ et.
It conc@@ e@@ als one challenge that will not be solved so quickly - how to force a person@@ , who is physi@@ cally in a very limited space to believe that he is wal@@ king along an open, almost limit@@ less spac@@ e; we are working on the concept of tre@@ ad@@ m@@ ills (@@ not at all like in club@@ s), moving plat@@ form@@ s, and giant ballo@@ ons.
So far dec@@ ei@@ ving the mind has had limited success, there@@ 's work for many years to come.
That@@ 's what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in their very beginn@@ ings.
Jud@@ gement calls instead of culture - Ros@@ bal@@ t@@ .@@ r@@ u
Ros@@ bal@@ t continues the project St. Petersburg A@@ v@@ ant@@ -@@ gar@@ de, dedicated to residents who are ahead, in the av@@ ant@@ -@@ gar@@ de of culture and ar@@ t.
This top list already includes outstanding figures of the art scene of St. Peters@@ bur@@ g, whose achievements reach beyond the scope of the city, often recognized in Europe, b@@ yp@@ ass@@ ing f@@ ame in Russia.
The new player in Ros@@ bal@@ t - the bold arti@@ st K@@ iri@@ ll M@@ ill@@ er.
The whole city knows K@@ iri@@ ll M@@ ill@@ er, a bear@@ ded man dres@@ sed all in red, who can be seen by the Russian Mus@@ e@@ um, or by the Sum@@ mer Gar@@ den, or at fashion@@ able parties and show@@ s.
K@@ iri@@ ll M@@ ill@@ er@@ 's work always brings in crow@@ ds of people, no matter where they are exhi@@ bit@@ ed.
K@@ iri@@ ll M@@ iller is one of the purely St. Petersburg social and philosophi@@ cal stor@@ y@@ tell@@ ers and cre@@ ators of new myth@@ ology.
K@@ iri@@ ll M@@ iller is an outstanding man of the St. Petersburg av@@ ant@@ -@@ gar@@ de of the late 80@@ 's early 90@@ 's.
Moreover, he is a city man, who makes people sm@@ ile on the street and lif@@ ts up every@@ one@@ 's spiri@@ t.
Rec@@ ently he took up the street or@@ gan and became St. Peters@@ bur@@ g@@ 's musi@@ c man, because he was ready for this complex role with all his Bo@@ h@@ emi@@ an exist@@ ence, philosophy and ima@@ ge.
- K@@ iri@@ ll@@ , why do you walk around the city all in red, not y@@ el@@ low or tur@@ quo@@ is@@ e, for examp@@ le@@ ?
- I chose the col@@ our red as a fashi@@ on desig@@ ner engaged in look and ima@@ ge.
In this world, red is a compromise between arti@@ st, ima@@ ge-@@ mak@@ er and society.
Although in society, everything that is not gre@@ y causes aggression and ag@@ itation of the bad kin@@ d.
But my provoc@@ ations are aimed at starting convers@@ ation.
The whole history of my provoc@@ ative actions is an inv@@ itation to discus@@ sion.
- When did you reali@@ se that you must be an arti@@ st@@ ?
- At an exhi@@ bi@@ tion in the N@@ ev@@ sky House of Cul@@ ture, where my work was disp@@ lay@@ ed.
It became clear to me that this is my path.
Then, the wave of older free, un@@ official arti@@ sts was g@@ one, while new, free arti@@ sts like me were not understo@@ od.
I became friends with the arti@@ sts of the new wa@@ ve, with post-@@ Gaz@@ a-@@ N@@ ev@@ sky style arti@@ sts (@@ "@@ post-@@ ga@@ zon@@ ev@@ sch@@ in@@ a@@ "@@ ), which led to P@@ ush@@ kin@@ sk@@ ay@@ a-@@ 1@@ 0, and the wave was no longer.
I@@ '@@ m drawn to the@@ at@@ re, clo@@ thing, musi@@ c, all gen@@ res except for literat@@ ure.
- And all this has been united in your Ar@@ t-@@ clin@@ ic@@ ... - It was important for me to find my@@ self in the cent@@ re of the culture of St. Peters@@ bur@@ g, where all the best creative forces should come together.
In 1995, I occupied the territory on P@@ ush@@ kin@@ sk@@ ay@@ a-@@ 1@@ 0, and while the ren@@ ov@@ ation work had not star@@ ted, there was a musi@@ cal and creative club@@ , a Bo@@ h@@ emi@@ an club@@ , the house of the St. Petersburg Bo@@ h@@ emi@@ a.
Many were born there@@ : N@@ OM@@ y, T@@ equ@@ ila Jaz@@ z, I remember when Sh@@ nur was brought there with the V@@ an Go@@ gh@@ 's E@@ ar project.
Sh@@ nur and his friends li@@ p s@@ ang easy son@@ gs, we@@ aring tight le@@ o@@ tar@@ ds, and the now tren@@ dy com@@ pos@@ er Ig@@ or V@@ do@@ v@@ in was with them.
When the group began to play liv@@ e, it became Len@@ ing@@ ra@@ d.
Tra@@ k@@ h@@ ten@@ berg was the pres@@ enter of many programs before H@@ ali@@ -@@ G@@ ali times.
We gave them Tra@@ k@@ h@@ ten@@ ber@@ g, and a great career was on its way, but the basic education and ment@@ oring he received from us.
G@@ all@@ ery D 13@@ 7, Gri@@ boy@@ ed@@ ov clu@@ b - all these ech@@ o the Ar@@ t-@@ clin@@ ic.
That is where our staff and regular customers left for@@ .
I am a her@@ o of the last century, when culture meant someth@@ ing.
In 2000, there was a poll in the press, for the People of Our City pri@@ ze.
I was nomin@@ ated Ar@@ tist of the Year@@ , my cli@@ ma@@ x came to an end.
In the new times, it is un@@ comfortable to work by old rules. I@@ '@@ m a man of truth, hon@@ esty and culture of the last century.
In our time, it is easy to become popul@@ ar, but culture and popularity are different. You can be popul@@ ar, but not very cultur@@ al.
- Y@@ our work is marked by a recogni@@ z@@ able sty@@ le.
- Many of my works are h@@ its, with clearly reflected relev@@ ance and acu@@ ity.
I will have a programme exhi@@ b@@ it, "@@ Russian mus@@ eum in c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ ."
C@@ low@@ ns are a tim@@ eless categ@@ or@@ y.
I was social before, now it is painful and sc@@ ary to be like that.
But everything is bl@@ ur@@ red in c@@ low@@ ns, tragedy is remo@@ ved.
I like grotes@@ qu@@ e, I have grotes@@ que ideas.
For example, saving the world by totalitarian changing of clo@@ th@@ es by order.
Nowadays, people are judged by appear@@ ance, not their inner quali@@ ties.
Who know@@ s, maybe you cannot sh@@ ake his hand, and need to sp@@ it in his face.
And the lie will go away with the help of changing clo@@ th@@ es.
- Rec@@ ently we saw you in the role of musi@@ c man. - A cultural city should have such a charac@@ ter.
Who fits the role better than I@@ ?
- May@@ be commercial art can also be beauti@@ ful@@ ?
- Nowadays, commercial art should be ne@@ at, consider@@ ate, swe@@ et.
There is a disintegration of cultur@@ es.
People used to get together in flo@@ ck@@ s, Bo@@ h@@ emi@@ ans lik@@ ed one thing, the simple people, something else.
Now, everybody is divided into m@@ ic@@ ro societies, it@@ 's hard to be lik@@ ed by everyone.
I am not a hundred dollar bill to ple@@ ase all.
Now you have to think who you will pleas@@ e.
Now, each cul@@ t her@@ o has 100 fan@@ s.
- But several thousand come to St@@ as Mik@@ ha@@ ilo@@ v@@ !
- The cast@@ -@@ outs go to see him, the sexu@@ al-@@ social sphere is at work there.
But 300 people will come for culture, not 10@@ ,00@@ 0. In the end, there@@ 's less management, money, everything dies out.
I have f@@ ans@@ ; the main thing is not to betra@@ y them, not to spo@@ il what I have ear@@ ned.
In my you@@ th, I pain@@ ted such art that one collec@@ tor had it hang@@ ing on the same wall with Fal@@ k and L@@ ari@@ on@@ ov@@ .
I started with pain@@ t@@ ings, which people usually end with@@ .
Con@@ cep@@ ts are often mixed up these days.
People sa@@ y: spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumer@@ ism, it@@ 's "@@ from another oper@@ a@@ ."
I am a man of y@@ ester@@ da@@ y's culture. I grew up on examples of arti@@ sts who lived poor and died in poverty, refused money for the sake of pain@@ ting.
This is the culture I@@ '@@ m for@@ .
- K@@ iri@@ ll@@ , what is St. Petersburg mis@@ sing@@ ?
- Good cultural exper@@ ts.
There is such a th@@ ing: an official for culture.
But not everyone can be engaged in culture.
Under the right rulers everything was different. K@@ ings may not have understood culture very well, but they understood that they needed to stick with the right exper@@ ts.
There are good consul@@ tan@@ ts in Moscow right now.
Here in St. Peters@@ bur@@ g, there are people who could be exper@@ ts, but they are pushed to the side, because more advanced experts are needed, who will correc@@ tly evaluate these experts and give way to them.
Jud@@ gement calls are what thri@@ ve now.
Even Er@@ ar@@ t, but the@@ y@@ '@@ re different because they say hon@@ est@@ ly that we don't accept all modern ar@@ t. There are some arti@@ sts, who need to find other mus@@ e@@ ums for themselves.
- What does St. Petersburg mean to you@@ ?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, Moscow has much more culture, there is be@@ dro@@ ck there.
It@@ 's hard for art to grow on our rock@@ s.
We need cultural be@@ dro@@ ck, but we now have more wri@@ ters than re@@ a@@ ders. This is wrong.
In Europe, there are many curi@@ ous people, who go to art exhi@@ bit@@ s, concer@@ ts.
Here, this lay@@ er is thin@@ .
We need to make art fashion@@ able, as it was in the beginning of last century.
The project is supported by the St. Petersburg gran@@ t.
Gi@@ ve birth in space
The earth is in dang@@ er.
Global warming or an en@@ counter with a kill@@ er ast@@ ero@@ id.
Car@@ av@@ ans of co@@ sm@@ ic ships with humans on board leave in search of a replacement planet.
To save human@@ ity, the question is how to propag@@ ate our race in conditions of weigh@@ tl@@ ess@@ ness or on that replacement plan@@ et@@ ?
I think the choice is sm@@ all.
There are only two actual plan@@ ets that can be expl@@ ored even hypo@@ the@@ tic@@ ally.
"@@ V@@ en@@ us and Mar@@ s@@ ," says Sen@@ ior Resear@@ cher of the P@@ .@@ K@@ . Sh@@ tern@@ berg State A@@ str@@ onom@@ y Institute (G@@ AI@@ Sh@@ ) Vladimir Sur@@ d@@ in.
But while conditions on Mar@@ s are more appropriate for life, V@@ en@@ us has 500@@ -@@ degree temperat@@ ures.
Life is possible only at a high al@@ titu@@ de or on the or@@ bit of V@@ en@@ us@@ ... in spac@@ e.
The question of re@@ production in space began with flor@@ a.
Hal@@ f a century ago, experiments were run on pl@@ ants.
Four generations of pe@@ as grown in or@@ bit were no different from their earth counterpar@@ ts.
Then, in@@ sec@@ ts were b@@ red in or@@ b@@ it, small fru@@ it fli@@ es.
In 1979, qu@@ ail eg@@ gs were sent to space, to check how an embr@@ yo develop@@ s in weigh@@ tl@@ ess@@ ness.
We get an absolutely normal chick@@ .
But then the problem beg@@ in@@ s.
"@@ The problem is related to the fact that this ch@@ ick needs to find support, needs to get on its fe@@ et and start mo@@ v@@ ing@@ ," explains head of the labor@@ atory of the Institute of Medical and Bi@@ ological Problems (@@ IM@@ B@@ P) R@@ A@@ N Vladimir Sy@@ ch@@ ev@@ .
Having found no support, chi@@ cks were tum@@ bling around in dis@@ order.
After 10 hour@@ s, the new@@ bor@@ ns experienced complete at@@ roph@@ y of instinc@@ ts.
Chi@@ cks did not react to light and sound@@ .
And the problem was that they simply died after four days.
"@@ We b@@ red chi@@ cks twice there, and then stopp@@ ed, because it is impossible to work with them there@@ ," says Vladimir Sy@@ ch@@ ev, con@@ fir@@ ming the failure of the experiment with chi@@ cks in spac@@ e.
The last biological "@@ min@@ i-@@ ark@@ " with animals fle@@ w into or@@ bit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, experiments will continue.
However, only sam@@ e-@@ sex beings will be on the Bi@@ on bio-@@ satelli@@ te.
There was an experiment with rat@@ s, who were sent to space with fo@@ et@@ us.
In principle, there was nothing extraordinary there.
"@@ This was on bio-@@ sat@@ el@@ lit@@ es, but again, it was a sing@@ ular experiment and such research needs to be conduc@@ ted@@ ," says Vladimir Sy@@ ch@@ ev@@ .
After land@@ ing, the co@@ sm@@ ic rats had bab@@ ies.
But it@@ 's hard to solve the problem of re@@ production directly in spac@@ e.
It@@ 's not an easy tas@@ k.
Ani@@ mals simply cannot follow their sexual instinc@@ t, when the@@ y@@ '@@ re out of their familiar environment.
In principle, people, unlike anim@@ als, can@@ .
Hom@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens have abstrac@@ t thinking, and are able to create a fit@@ ting emotional back@@ ground.
Such experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
But women have been fl@@ ying to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was for Ter@@ es@@ h@@ kov@@ a.
The most valuable thing for humanity is the female bod@@ y.
Our "@@ Se@@ ag@@ ul@@ l@@ " left and nobody on earth could tell whether she would be O@@ K after fl@@ ying to spac@@ e.
Whether she will be able to give birth after this f@@ light.
"@@ No@@ body answer@@ ed this question@@ ," says rock@@ et and space industry veter@@ an, V@@ akh@@ t@@ ang V@@ ach@@ nad@@ ze.
In June 196@@ 4, only a year after fl@@ ying to space, the first woman in space Val@@ ent@@ ina Ter@@ es@@ h@@ kov@@ a gave birth to a daugh@@ ter.
The child@@ 's father, An@@ dri@@ an Ni@@ kol@@ a@@ ev, was also a co@@ s@@ mon@@ au@@ t.
In 198@@ 8, the second woman co@@ s@@ mon@@ au@@ t, S@@ vet@@ lan@@ a S@@ av@@ it@@ sk@@ ay@@ a, who went into or@@ bit twice and even worked in open space, gave birth to a son@@ .
However, the risk remain@@ s.
We have fe@@ w, very few co@@ s@@ mon@@ au@@ ts, who were O@@ K and had healthy children after long f@@ ligh@@ ts.
"@@ What@@ 's more, it is dangerous even for or@@ bit@@ al f@@ ligh@@ ts@@ ," adds pilo@@ t and co@@ s@@ mon@@ au@@ t, Her@@ o of the USS@@ R@@ , Her@@ o of Russia, Val@@ ery Poli@@ ak@@ ov@@ .
And yet, humanity needs to seek out some new aven@@ u@@ es in bio@@ technologies, protection from radi@@ ation, creation of artificial grav@@ ity.
Hy@@ dro@@ -@@ labor@@ atory of CP@@ K - mandatory phase of training for a f@@ light.
Here, co@@ s@@ mon@@ au@@ ts practice skills of working in open space in zero-@@ grav@@ ity conditions.
Water im@@ it@@ ates weigh@@ tl@@ ess@@ ness.
If for adults water is a foreign medi@@ um, although comfort@@ able, for inf@@ ants it is a n@@ ative el@@ ement.
Small amp@@ hi@@ bi@@ ans seem to confirm that life came to land from the oce@@ an.
There is a connection with the fact that an inf@@ ant spends about 9 months in am@@ ni@@ o@@ tic flu@@ id in the wom@@ b@@ ; it is easier to get used to water after that.
In principle, it is logi@@ cal, because only two weeks pass from birth until the first b@@ ath@@ ing.
"@@ This is very little time to forget someth@@ ing@@ ," says inf@@ ant swi@@ mm@@ ing instruc@@ tor Mar@@ ina Ak@@ sen@@ ov@@ a.
In other words, if for a new@@ born weigh@@ tl@@ ess@@ ness is more natur@@ al, a woman needs grav@@ ity, earth@@ 's pul@@ l.
St@@ om@@ ach and pel@@ vic mus@@ c@@ les usually quickly de@@ generate in weigh@@ tl@@ ess@@ ness@@ ; the ability to push out the embr@@ yo is reduc@@ ed.
W@@ ell, let@@ 's assume that child@@ birth stimul@@ ators will work out.
May@@ be she will push out the baby in a special room@@ .
"@@ Then what@@ ?" - as@@ ks Val@@ ery Poli@@ ak@@ ov about this non-@@ trivi@@ al issue.
On the other hand, a baby also needs artificial grav@@ ity.
When a body does not feel the earth@@ 's pul@@ l, it does not form the sk@@ el@@ et@@ al and mus@@ cul@@ ar system.
It is not possible to d@@ ress a new@@ born in or@@ bit into a special lo@@ ading suit for training, as they do with adul@@ ts.
He will simply not have what he needs to survi@@ ve.
"@@ And this experi@@ ment, that we will go for by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to us bringing a han@@ dic@@ app@@ ed, completely un@@ adap@@ ted human to earth@@ ," predic@@ ts Chairman of the Committee on Bio@@ ethics IM@@ B@@ P R@@ A@@ N Ig@@ or P@@ est@@ ov@@ .
For the moment, birth of children in space is just a theor@@ y.
However, with time, it will become reality, when earth@@ l@@ ings will go to a far@@ away planet in their ships, and it will become the home for their off@@ spr@@ ing, who were born in spac@@ e.
N@@ K@@ U He@@ ad@@ : S@@ var@@ c System audi@@ t has failed because of politicians.
The Czech Republic has sound control bodies and a good standard of legislation when it comes to public contrac@@ ts, but it lag@@ s behind in their applic@@ ation.
This was said by Milo@@ sla@@ v Kal@@ a, vic@@ e-@@ president of the Supreme Au@@ di@@ t Office (N@@ K@@ U) in an inter@@ view for Ak@@ tu@@ al@@ ne@@ .@@ c@@ z.
"@@ The Law will never be perfec@@ t, but its application should be just - this is what we are miss@@ ing, in my opini@@ on@@ ," states Kal@@ a, comment@@ ing on the current situation.
Similar conclusions are also reached by the joint audi@@ t from the Czech and German audi@@ tors.
As an example of impro@@ per practice, they cite Pet@@ r N@@ ec@@ as@@ 's approach to the so-called "@@ S@@ var@@ c System@@ ."
The Prime Minister recently claimed that the O@@ D@@ S will not be burden@@ ing business owners with its checks - so is it for@@ bid@@ den or allow@@ ed?
"@@ The Law must be set out one way or the other and if it prohi@@ bits someth@@ ing, then even the Govern@@ ment@@ 's head cannot prevent the work of its depart@@ ment, which is d@@ ut@@ y-@@ bound to monitor and enforc@@ e@@ ," asser@@ ts Kal@@ a.
At the audi@@ t committe@@ e's s@@ ession in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech Republic and Germany, within which legislation rel@@ ating to public contracts in both countries was compar@@ ed.
What exactly was this ab@@ out@@ ?
This is about parallel audi@@ ting, which we began around two years ago.
Simply put, this is about how European legislation govern@@ s the handling of public contrac@@ ts, followed by individual state legisl@@ ations and then the actual practice itself.
We brought all this together, and although the audi@@ t is not yet comple@@ te, some very interesting differences have become apparent - in general terms, our legislation might be even "@@ more conc@@ ise and comple@@ te@@ ," however the actual practice is in certain aspects better in Germany.
This con@@ firms that creating more and more conc@@ ise rules is not enough, and that attention must be paid to the actual application of these law@@ s.
What does this project actually help you with@@ , and what do you think its outcome will bring@@ ?
This kind of joint audi@@ t could contribute to curtail@@ ing these efforts to speci@@ fy our law, to reduce and perfect bound@@ aries, when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economy means acqu@@ iring the required thing at a reasonable (which does not always mean the low@@ est@@ ) price, so that profit@@ e@@ ering and possible criminal proceed@@ ings may be avoide@@ d.
However, just because we have reduced the order limit@@ s, does not mean something will be proc@@ u@@ red.
The system might become over@@ lo@@ aded with the amount of pap@@ er@@ work, and tho@@ se, who wish to look for lo@@ op@@ hol@@ es in it, will be able to take advantage far more easily than if the limits had remained higher.
These are domestic problems about the practical implementation of legislation rel@@ ating to public contrac@@ ts.
How does the audi@@ t system work in German@@ y?
Is there an office like the N@@ K@@ U@@ , or is it organis@@ ed differ@@ ent@@ ly@@ ?
As far as the office is concerne@@ d, the Bundes@@ rech@@ n@@ ung@@ shof functions like our N@@ K@@ U@@ , and it is organis@@ ed like our@@ s, it also has a committee although it is appointed slightly differ@@ ently, but basically both offic@@ es operate simil@@ ar@@ ly.
Power@@ s are also similar to a degre@@ e, though of course Germany is organis@@ ed feder@@ ally, so these courts of audi@@ tors are also at the member state levels - in this respect their system slightly diff@@ ers from our own.
The BR@@ H can only audi@@ t federal money, known to us as state funds.
Public funds, which, for us, are administ@@ ered by regional and municipal authorities, are audi@@ ted by the federal courts of audi@@ tors there.
When it comes to their legislation, is it more straight@@ forward than our@@ s?
Over@@ all, I would not like to make a comparison without any specific data, ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless in certain respec@@ ts Germany serves as an example, but it certainly cannot be said that it is better in every aspec@@ t.
Is this because, perhaps, they have better enforc@@ ement@@ ?
That is certainly not true, but again, I prefer not to make such comparis@@ ons.
It should be said that even in a country we perceive as ex@@ empl@@ ary, they en@@ counter a whole range of problems.
If that were not the case, they would gain nothing from working with our office, would the@@ y?
Com@@ ing back to domestic legislation, what did the amend@@ ment to public contracts legislation mean for your office, is its impact being felt alread@@ y?
The period since the amend@@ ment came into force has been quite short, so it has not manifest@@ ed itself in our audi@@ t work y@@ et.
Since we carry out our audi@@ ts ex-@@ po@@ st, a certain delay has to be taken into accoun@@ t.
As yet, we have only observed it within the process of preparing future audi@@ ts - we have launched our new "@@ fiscal failure risk detec@@ tion@@ " system, with which we have proc@@ essed almost 14 thousand public contrac@@ ts, and these have been analy@@ sed - that is where changes will clearly be se@@ en, because of the changed limit@@ s, the adjusted conditions governing certain types of selection process@@ es, and so on.
So do you see the adoption of this legislation as a benef@@ it, or rather as another burden on the bureaucratic system@@ ?
I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction, and I hope this will be confirm@@ ed.
A problem, which may arise here, is that the law becomes "@@ too constrain@@ ed@@ " and will not be enforc@@ e@@ able.
Under the previous rules, parties being audi@@ ted were already bound by their audi@@ t provi@@ der (for example, in the case of regional operational programm@@ es, the regional offic@@ e) to the fact that every inf@@ rin@@ gement of public contracts law means a bre@@ ach of budgetary discipl@@ ine.
Is it worth constra@@ ining the law in this way, in that cas@@ e?
I do not think this is the way.
The system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it, but not pen@@ ali@@ se tho@@ se, who make a mistake on a techni@@ c@@ ality, which does not affect the final decision.
This kind of system will only increase pressure on bureaucra@@ cy.
So how can we get out of this@@ ?
L@@ et@@ 's see where this dead@@ -@@ end takes us.
The Prime Minister recently said the O@@ D@@ S will not be burden@@ ing business@@ men with audi@@ ts of the so-called "@@ S@@ var@@ c System@@ " - what does this mean@@ ?
Is the S@@ var@@ c System prohi@@ bited or allow@@ ed?
The Law must be set out one way or the other, and if it prohi@@ bits someth@@ ing, then even the Govern@@ ment@@ 's head cannot prevent the work of its depart@@ ment, which is d@@ ut@@ y-@@ bound to monitor and enforc@@ e.
He may sa@@ y: "@@ Let us change this law and rel@@ a@@ x it@@ ," but he cannot say we should pre@@ tend it is not there.
The law on public contracts has relatively strict rules about the formali@@ ties which must be adher@@ ed to - which is the right way to ensure public ten@@ ders are protec@@ ted.
On the other hand, it is a tra@@ ged@@ y, when a bid@@ der with the best offer is excluded on a techni@@ c@@ ality.
The Law will never be perfec@@ t, but its application should be just - this is what we are miss@@ ing, in my opini@@ on.
Ro@@ ads are ic@@ y in places, but mostly pass@@ able.
In several places in the Czech Republic, the main roads are ic@@ y and s@@ now@@ y.
However, the majority of roads are pass@@ able, with extra care needed in plac@@ es.
Car@@ l@@ s@@ bad region
In the Car@@ l@@ s@@ bad region, the roads have been us@@ able this mor@@ ning, though in some places they were ic@@ y and s@@ now@@ y.
The temperature has dropped to between five and ten degrees below zer@@ o, though it is expected to get warm slightly during the day.
Snow@@ ing in the region has stopp@@ ed, and only a thin lay@@ er of s@@ now remains in the low@@ lands.
However, the rid@@ ges of the K@@ rus@@ ne Mo@@ un@@ tains have around 30 cen@@ tim@@ et@@ res of s@@ now.
In some loc@@ ations there is limited visi@@ bility due to m@@ ist, according to the local high@@ way servic@@ e.
The R@@ 6 high-@@ speed mo@@ tor@@ way and primary roads in the region are now us@@ able without restric@@ tion.
Cau@@ tion is, of course, appropri@@ ate, for example, on certain brid@@ ges, where the surface can be ic@@ y and sli@@ p@@ per@@ y.
All secondary and ter@@ ti@@ ary roads are also pass@@ able, including moun@@ tain road@@ s.
In certain stret@@ ches of these roads there might be remaining fro@@ zen and comp@@ acted s@@ now pat@@ ch@@ es.
Above all, at higher levels, extra care should be taken while dri@@ v@@ ing.
Par@@ dubi@@ ce and H@@ ra@@ de@@ c K@@ ral@@ o@@ ve region
On some roads in Eastern Bo@@ h@@ emi@@ a, there might be a risk of black ic@@ e, at higher al@@ titu@@ des and in the moun@@ tains there might be a lay@@ er of comp@@ acted s@@ now, according to the Road and Mo@@ tor@@ way Direc@@ tor@@ ate.
The high@@ way service is warning the drivers against black ic@@ e, which might occur at higher al@@ titu@@ des of the Par@@ dubi@@ ce region in particul@@ ar.
Black ice may occur around L@@ an@@ sk@@ ro@@ un, U@@ st@@ i n@@ ad Or@@ li@@ ci@@ , Poli@@ ck@@ y, S@@ vit@@ av@@ y, and V@@ y@@ so@@ ke My@@ to, and particularly on secondary and ter@@ ti@@ ary road@@ s.
The I@@ /@@ 4@@ 3 and I@@ /@@ 34 roads have been chem@@ ically treated around S@@ vit@@ av@@ y.
S@@ now is particularly affecting the roads in the K@@ r@@ kon@@ ose and Or@@ li@@ cke moun@@ tain@@ s.
At higher al@@ titu@@ des, there is a comp@@ acted s@@ now lay@@ er on the roads around Ry@@ ch@@ no@@ v n@@ ad K@@ ne@@ z@@ no@@ u and Tru@@ t@@ nov@@ .
In Eastern Bo@@ h@@ emi@@ a the day will be mostly clear to partly clo@@ ud@@ y, and dr@@ y.
Temperat@@ ures will be between min@@ us three and plus one degree Celsius most@@ ly, with a light win@@ d.
Pil@@ sen region
The roads in the Pil@@ sen region have been us@@ able this mor@@ ning, with extra care needed in some plac@@ es. D@@ ri@@ vers should take the weather conditions into accoun@@ t.
The mor@@ ning will be fro@@ st@@ y, with temperatures ranging between three and nine degrees below zero.
D@@ ue to the existing s@@ now and subsequent drop in temperat@@ ure, certain roads may be ic@@ y.
D@@ ri@@ vers should expect m@@ ist in places, though visi@@ bility will gradually impro@@ ve.
This information was reported by the region@@ 's high@@ way servic@@ e.
The D@@ 5 mo@@ tor@@ way is dri@@ v@@ able almost without restric@@ tion, but the road services recommen@@ d extra cau@@ tion between the 80@@ th and 13@@ 1@@ st kil@@ om@@ et@@ re mark@@ s.
Most primary road sur@@ faces are dr@@ y and fro@@ st-@@ free.
Southern areas of the Pil@@ sen and T@@ ach@@ ov regions may have ic@@ y pat@@ ch@@ es.
Sec@@ on@@ dary and ter@@ ti@@ ary roads are w@@ et, and may therefore also have ic@@ y pat@@ ch@@ es.
D@@ ri@@ vers should be cautious especially on less frequ@@ ented roads in the Bo@@ h@@ emi@@ an For@@ est.
Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region
D@@ ri@@ vers should expect s@@ now s@@ lus@@ h on the roads if heading for the higher parts of the Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region.
It is a result of the chemical treatment carried out at C@@ er@@ ven@@ o@@ hor@@ k@@ se sed@@ lo and on the way to V@@ id@@ el@@ sky Kri@@ z.
Snow@@ plo@@ u@@ gh@@ s were brought out by falling s@@ now overnigh@@ t, the Sum@@ per@@ k region, according to high@@ way mainten@@ ance, got around three cen@@ tim@@ et@@ res of s@@ now.
In other parts of the region, roads are mainly pass@@ able without restric@@ tions.
"@@ In the Sum@@ per@@ k region, tra@@ ces of s@@ now have remained at the highest al@@ titu@@ des.
D@@ ri@@ vers should expect s@@ now s@@ lus@@ h at C@@ er@@ ven@@ o@@ hor@@ sk@@ e sed@@ lo in the direction of J@@ esen@@ ik@@ ," the disp@@ at@@ ch offic@@ er for the Sum@@ per@@ k high@@ way service told C@@ T@@ K today.
Their J@@ esen@@ ik counterparts also made an ou@@ ting overnigh@@ t; the roads all the way to the highest al@@ titu@@ des are now clear and we@@ t following the chemical treatment, according to them.
The Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region@@ 's roads are us@@ able without restric@@ tion, while in the area of Stern@@ ber@@ k drivers should bew@@ are in wo@@ o@@ ded areas, where roads have remained w@@ et.
U@@ st@@ i n@@ ad La@@ be@@ m region, Liber@@ e@@ c region
Since this mor@@ ning, the s@@ now@@ plo@@ u@@ gh@@ s have reported several places, which are difficult to pass in northern Bo@@ h@@ emi@@ a.
Bes@@ i@@ des certain s@@ now@@ -@@ covered places, or some ic@@ y fro@@ st pat@@ ch@@ es, the moun@@ tain road from Tel@@ ni@@ ce to Kn@@ ini@@ ce in the U@@ st@@ i n@@ ad La@@ be@@ m region is also clos@@ ed, according to the police dat@@ ab@@ as@@ e.
Temperat@@ ures remain below zero and roads are likely to remain s@@ now@@ y and ic@@ y. In the low@@ lands, however, particularly sou@@ theast of the Central Bo@@ h@@ emi@@ an U@@ pl@@ and@@ s, there are no problems and roads are mostly dr@@ y.
No traffic hol@@ d-@@ ups have so far been repor@@ ted.
I@@ cy fro@@ st pat@@ ches have been reported in particular by road mainten@@ ance around Ste@@ ti@@ .
According to me@@ te@@ or@@ ologists the conditions for this were perfect - rain and mel@@ ting s@@ now during the day, with a clear night and free@@ zing temperat@@ ures.
Ad@@ verse conditions are expected on the main sec@@ tions of the I@@ /@@ 13 road between the U@@ st@@ i n@@ ad La@@ be@@ m and Liber@@ e@@ c regions.
The clo@@ sure of the Tel@@ ni@@ ce to Kn@@ ini@@ ce road was caused by b@@ ent tre@@ e bran@@ ch@@ es, which were weigh@@ ed down to road level by s@@ now@@ fall.
Sim@@ on Or@@ n@@ est@@ : At the concer@@ ts we want a fusion of positive energy
What is your opinion on the end of the world that might come in less than a month@@ ?
It is just another star@@ tl@@ er, which we like to lat@@ ch on to.
Toge@@ ther with The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p b@@ and, we tend to j@@ oke about it, saying that we might be the only band on earth that could draw enough positive energy to hold off or avert the end of the world comple@@ tel@@ y.
In December you are even organis@@ ing a unique series of three concer@@ ts against the end of the world.
Can you give our re@@ a@@ ders some details on this@@ ?
This is a nation@@ wide fund@@ -@@ raising ev@@ ent, which we have been planning for the past two years.
We decided to make use of the market@@ ing potential of the end of the May@@ an cal@@ en@@ dar, due on the 2@@ 1@@ st of December at 11@@ :@@ 10 a@@ .@@ m.
On the ev@@ e, the 20@@ th of December, at 9@@ p@@ m, 3 concer@@ ts will take place in parallel in Pra@@ gu@@ e, Br@@ no@@ , and O@@ stra@@ v@@ a.
They will end at around the time when K@@ iri@@ bat@@ i Island in the Pacific@@ , which is 12 hours ahead of us, reaches the end of the May@@ an cal@@ en@@ dar.
Who came up with this ide@@ a?
Initi@@ ally it was probably my idea, later we worked all the details out with our desig@@ ner, Hon@@ za Augu@@ st@@ a.
A@@ part from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to stop the end of the world, we also want to allow ourselves and the public to sp@@ are some though@@ ts for the state of our plan@@ et, when we, one day, hand it over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May@@ an cal@@ en@@ dar, we have also prepared a range of unique it@@ em@@ s, sho@@ es, t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ ts, bag@@ s, and original ke@@ ys against the end of the world, which can be purchas@@ ed at www.@@ e-@@ tap@@ .@@ c@@ z to support our cause.
The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p b@@ and, together with other arti@@ sts, also recorded the so-called an@@ them against the end of the world, called "@@ The End of the World is canc@@ el@@ led@@ ."
It is already well received on You@@ Tu@@ be, will it figure at the fund@@ -@@ raising concer@@ ts@@ ?
Of course, for the grand fin@@ ale, as long as the world does not end befor@@ eh@@ and.
It will be sung by all the arti@@ sts at all the three concer@@ ts at the same time.
The an@@ them will also be feat@@ ured in a unique live broad@@ cast on Czech Tel@@ evi@@ sion.
The words were written and the role of J@@ es@@ us in the video cli@@ p was played by Tom@@ as Han@@ ak, X@@ ind@@ l X also s@@ ings in it@@ ...
How did you end up working with them@@ ?
We collabor@@ ate also with other person@@ alities of the Czech cultural scen@@ e, due to organis@@ ing a lot of fund@@ -@@ raising events and concer@@ ts@@ ...
We try to really get them involved in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the proce@@ eds from the conc@@ ert against the end of the world go to@@ ?
E@@ qui@@ pping the whe@@ el@@ chair@@ -@@ accessible educational Stu@@ de@@ o cent@@ re, which is already in its six@@ th year, in collaboration with the citizens association Ta@@ p from the Jed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute for the dis@@ able@@ d.
T@@ ut@@ ors come in regularly to spend time with the Jed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institu@@ te@@ 's students and run activities, which they enjoy and interest them.
The students themselves do not have the funds to afford t@@ ut@@ ors, so we try to provide this for them in this way.
Within the construction project at the Jed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institu@@ te, a separate building is plan@@ ned, which we can move into with this project.
Every conc@@ ert sees the appearance of several b@@ ands and arti@@ sts.
How do you select them@@ ?
We have tried to comp@@ ile a programm@@ e, which speaks for all ages, including children.
For example, in Pra@@ gu@@ e, Chin@@ ask@@ i, Sup@@ port Les@@ bi@@ ens, Illu@@ strat@@ o@@ sphere with Dan Bar@@ ta, The Ta@@ p T@@ ap@@ , M@@ arian Bang@@ o and J@@ ir@@ i Su@@ ch@@ y will appe@@ ar.
Fur@@ ther details can be found at www.@@ k@@ p@@ ks@@ .@@ c@@ z.
Are you planning any more "@@ bom@@ bas@@ tic event@@ s" in the future@@ ?
In May, we will be making our first appearance in the Pra@@ gue Spr@@ ing, so we will definit@@ ely be preparing a good line-@@ up with some interesting gu@@ est@@ s.
Next year, we would like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally - since we will be in the USA - would like to build in appear@@ ances in Washington and Chic@@ ago.
Y@@ our international plans are not mo@@ dest@@ ; you have already perform@@ ed, for instance, in Mad@@ ri@@ d, Brussel@@ s, London, and Mosco@@ w.
The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p is nonetheless a band composed of han@@ dic@@ apped people.
How do you cope with these jour@@ ne@@ ys in terms of log@@ istics and organis@@ ation?
It is not as sc@@ ary as it might seem at first.
We have five members in electric whe@@ el@@ chair@@ s, which must be transpor@@ ted in the lu@@ gg@@ age are@@ a; we must also, of course, carry around with us a lot of lu@@ gg@@ age and instrument cas@@ es@@ ...
Nevertheless, we have so far managed it without any problems, CS@@ A and British Air@@ ways were well prepared for us, so much so that, on occa@@ sion, I was quite surpris@@ ed.
Even in Mosco@@ w, which we have just returned fro@@ m, it all went smoo@@ th@@ ly.
Thanks to these international tri@@ p@@ s, you will have had a chance to compare specific accessi@@ bility issues, public attitudes to dis@@ ability and so on.
What have been your experiences so far@@ ?
After Mad@@ ri@@ d, Lux@@ embo@@ ur@@ g, London and other places, where everything functions better than here, we have just witnessed that in the East everything is still in its beginn@@ ings.
Compar@@ ed to Pra@@ gu@@ e, Moscow is rather in@@ accessi@@ ble@@ ; it still remains unusual there for a person in an electric whe@@ el@@ ch@@ air to be tra@@ v@@ elling around the city cent@@ re on his or her own.
Ob@@ vious things, such as giving whe@@ el@@ chair@@ s priority in lif@@ ts, are not common@@ place there.
Fortunately, citizens associ@@ ations are emerging there too that are trying to draw attention to the problems faced by people with dis@@ abili@@ ties.
And on the other hand, where do we still lag behind more advanced countri@@ es?
There are a lot of things, which we still lag behind on@@ ...
It is important to mention that improvements to the current situation always depend on the efforts of the people who are affec@@ ted.
In London and Madrid it is completely natural for people with serious han@@ dic@@ aps to be indepen@@ dently out in public, and they can use the to@@ i@@ le@@ ts, go to the mus@@ e@@ um, or wher@@ ever@@ ...
It is less common there for large groups of people with dis@@ abilities to actively take part in social life, in this respect with The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p we are a step ahe@@ ad@@ !
Public respect or accessi@@ bility is one thing, but it is only when we can become famous ath@@ let@@ es, arti@@ sts, ac@@ tors, politicians, or lawyers that things will really begin to change.
So far there are only exceptional cases, people who are strong@@ -@@ wil@@ led.
The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band is currently very popul@@ ar, but let us look back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to form it?
I began my job as a t@@ ut@@ or at the Jed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institu@@ te, where I was surrounded by a lot of young people, who were interested in doing someth@@ ing.
Since I am a musi@@ cian my@@ self - among others I play the sa@@ x@@ op@@ h@@ one - I started a musi@@ c clu@@ b with a colleagu@@ e.
With time, as our moder@@ ator Lad@@ ya Angel@@ o@@ vic say@@ s, it has grown a little out of our control (@@ laugh@@ ).
Y@@ our popularity has only come about in the last few years, or am I mistak@@ en?
It is true that we have been helped by creating ties to famous sing@@ ers and also by our pro@@ active work on promoting the b@@ and.
We re@@ alis@@ ed that work, which goes on un@@ seen can be like it never exist@@ ed.
Thanks to funds from the European Union we can even afford top quality t@@ ut@@ ors, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to take The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p to such hei@@ gh@@ ts@@ ?
From the outs@@ et, I felt there was potential to do things a little differ@@ ently.
S@@ how business is filled with things, where one im@@ it@@ ates the other.
It is logical in its own way@@ ; all new things are taken in hesit@@ antly and take a long time.
Th@@ ings, which are uniqu@@ e, are few and far bet@@ we@@ en, but I would d@@ are to claim that Ta@@ p Ta@@ p is one of those th@@ ings.
A person@@ 's first impression on seeing you is, of course, p@@ ity - it is a natural reac@@ tion@@ ...
But that p@@ ity is simply wast@@ ed, because han@@ dic@@ apped people are not abandoned and suffering bein@@ gs, who need to be pi@@ ti@@ ed.
They are people, who can fully live life and b@@ los@@ som@@ , assum@@ ing, of course, that they have the right environment for it.
I say that when a person with a han@@ dic@@ ap succe@@ eds in someth@@ ing, it is not just progress for them but for society as a whole.
H@@ as your success also been helped by your firm hand as a leader, as many people are suggest@@ ing?
If we want to achieve top class work, we must be un@@ com@@ promising in many things and require a certain level of discipl@@ ine.
I think this is to be expected.
Some people come to us with a roman@@ tic idea and their head in the clo@@ ud@@ s, and when they find out they have to go to re@@ hear@@ s@@ als twice a week, attend practice s@@ essions and put up with a lot of time tra@@ v@@ elling to concer@@ ts, their enthusiasm quickly disappear@@ s.
That is how it works everywhere, with every group that wants to work and wants to achieve someth@@ ing.
The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band currently has twent@@ y members.
How many of those were present at the beginning in 199@@ 8@@ ?
Only one, Lad@@ ya Angel@@ o@@ vic@@ .
We are an open group, people come and people go, this is unavoid@@ able.
Those who have the interest and the drive will always find our door op@@ en.
The event takes place the day before the end of the world is expec@@ ted, on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day 20@@ .@@ 1@@ 2.@@ 2012 from 9@@ p@@ m.
The ven@@ u@@ es will be Pra@@ ha In@@ ch@@ eb@@ a, Br@@ no F@@ le@@ da, and O@@ stra@@ va Pl@@ y@@ no@@ j@@ em with performan@@ ces from 12 b@@ ands and other musi@@ cians from the Czech Republic@@ .
All three cities will be joined by a tel@@ ev@@ ised link@@ -up at the even@@ ing@@ 's close for a united rendi@@ tion of The Ta@@ p T@@ ap@@ 's an@@ them "@@ The End of the World is canc@@ el@@ led@@ "
The concer@@ t@@ 's goal is to raise funds to equi@@ p the ST@@ U@@ D@@ E@@ O multi-@@ functional whe@@ el-@@ ch@@ air accessible learning cent@@ re at the Jed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute in Pra@@ gue in the sum of 25 million Czech crow@@ ns.
Ad@@ mission fe@@ e to the conc@@ ert is 400 C@@ Z@@ K@@ , children under 12 years of age go free, tick@@ ets on sale from Bo@@ h@@ emi@@ ati@@ ck@@ et.
Poland and the Co@@ smo@@ s.
Last week the coun@@ cil of ministers of the European Sp@@ ace Agency admitted Poland as the twentieth member of the agen@@ cy, being the second nation from the former Eastern B@@ lock (@@ after the Czech Republic, which became a fully f@@ ledged member of the ES@@ A on the 12@@ th of November 2008@@ ).
Poland began close cooperation with the ES@@ A in 1994, and in the following years it has particip@@ ated in a series of agency projects.
Of course, Pol@@ and@@ 's path to the space had begun much ear@@ lier@@ .
Polish bo@@ ff@@ ins devoted their time to space flight even before the Second World War, but were not always met with understand@@ ing.
I look back, for instance, to the lec@@ ture of A Stern@@ feld in War@@ sa@@ w@@ 's ast@@ r@@ onom@@ y observ@@ ator@@ y, who, on the 6@@ th of December 193@@ 3, presented ideas on his pione@@ ering work En@@ try into spac@@ e.
The though@@ ts of the young engine@@ er (@@ born 190@@ 5@@ ) left his audience col@@ d, and years later Stern@@ feld remembered that only Dr. J@@ an G@@ ad@@ om@@ ski had shown an interest in his work.
In 193@@ 4, for his work En@@ try into space, Stern@@ feld received the Robert Es@@ n@@ aul@@ t-@@ P@@ el@@ ter@@ ie and An@@ dr@@ e Lou@@ is Hir@@ sch prize in France.
The above mentioned Dr. J@@ an G@@ ad@@ om@@ ski (@@ 189@@ 9 - 196@@ 6@@ ) later became a strong promo@@ ter of ast@@ r@@ onom@@ y and ast@@ ron@@ au@@ tic@@ s.
He published hundreds of ar@@ ticles in Polish journ@@ als, and wrote a series of books on these scientific subjec@@ ts.
G@@ ad@@ om@@ ski became a world-@@ known promo@@ ter of ast@@ ron@@ au@@ tics and his contribution was, not@@ ably, reco@@ g@@ nis@@ ed when a crat@@ er on the far side of the Mo@@ on was named after him.
In 192@@ 5, Poland had already built a hand@@ car which was supposed to be fit@@ ted with a rock@@ et eng@@ ine.
Unfortunately, both the projec@@ t@@ 's desig@@ ner, and the projec@@ t@@ 's detail@@ s, are unknow@@ n.
It is not even clear, whether the rock@@ et was intended to start the hand@@ car or to slow it down.
Information about this ra@@ il track is only known from press ar@@ ticles of the time.
In 193@@ 3 the Polish arti@@ ll@@ ery started their engagement in fl@@ ying bomb@@ s.
The research was undertaken by the We@@ ap@@ ons Technology Di@@ vision in collaboration with Prof@@ . Mi@@ ec@@ zy@@ s@@ law Wolf@@ ke and Prof@@ . Gu@@ sta@@ w Mo@@ k@@ r@@ zy@@ ck@@ i.
From the docum@@ ents, it is clear that the research reached the stage of practical test@@ s.
Of course, the advance of the German army interrup@@ ted the research.
In 193@@ 7, the concept of a photo@@ electric hom@@ ing rock@@ et designed by engine@@ er Ro@@ ho@@ zin@@ ski appeared in the trade press, and in the following year The Ro@@ ck@@ et - air tor@@ ped@@ o and fl@@ ying rock@@ et-@@ bomb appear@@ ed, auth@@ ored by L@@ eli@@ w@@ y-@@ K@@ ry@@ wo@@ block@@ i.
Both projects were dest@@ ined for military use of rock@@ et eng@@ ines.
Im@@ medi@@ ately prior to the War, all projects for military use of rock@@ et technologies were over@@ seen by the Provi@@ sional Scienti@@ fic Advis@@ ory Board (@@ Ty@@ m@@ c@@ z@@ as@@ ow@@ y Komit@@ et Dor@@ ad@@ c@@ zo@@ -@@ N@@ au@@ kow@@ y) that coordinated all the work.
The Board was appointed in 193@@ 7, but after two years of activity their operations were ended by the start of the War.
Fur@@ ther work devoted to ast@@ ron@@ au@@ tics appeared in the Polish Pres@@ s after the War thanks to the Polish A@@ stron@@ au@@ tics Comp@@ any (@@ Pol@@ sk@@ ie To@@ war@@ zy@@ st@@ wo A@@ stron@@ au@@ ty@@ c@@ z@@ ne@@ ).
The first reference to the company figures in the November issue of the maga@@ z@@ ine Problems in 195@@ 4, in which four in-@@ depth ar@@ ticles are on the subject of ast@@ ron@@ au@@ tic@@ s.
In one of th@@ ese, by Prof@@ . Sub@@ o@@ to@@ wi@@ c@@ z, the establishment of a company is propos@@ ed, which would de@@ dic@@ ate itself to ast@@ ron@@ au@@ tic@@ s.
At the time, there were already projects underway for artificial satelli@@ tes and it was clear that co@@ sm@@ ic research was an emerging sector.
From the beginning of 195@@ 6, the Polish A@@ stron@@ au@@ tics Comp@@ any (P@@ T@@ A) sought entry to the International A@@ stron@@ au@@ tics Feder@@ ation (@@ est. 195@@ 1) and by autum@@ n the P@@ T@@ A was already a full member@@ .
In the following year, the P@@ T@@ A@@ 's first chair@@ man, Ka@@ zi@@ mier@@ z Zar@@ ank@@ ie@@ wi@@ c@@ z (@@ 190@@ 2 - 195@@ 9@@ ) was appointed Dep@@ uty Chairman for the International A@@ stron@@ au@@ tics Feder@@ ation.
He served in this capacity until his death in 195@@ 9.
From 195@@ 6, the P@@ T@@ A played a significant role in the successful development of me@@ te@@ or@@ ological rock@@ ets R@@ M (@@ Rak@@ i@@ et@@ a Me@@ te@@ or@@ ologi@@ c@@ z@@ na@@ ), which became the first Polish rock@@ et to enable scientific research.
The first RM@@ -@@ 1 model was completed in 195@@ 7 and the first launch took place on the 10@@ th of October 195@@ 8.
The rock@@ et, with a ceiling of 18@@ 00 met@@ res, measured around 80 c@@ m in leng@@ th and weigh@@ ed a little under 5 k@@ g.
Lat@@ er, the improved RM@@ -@@ 1@@ A version was construc@@ ted and in the summer of 195@@ 9 launch tests were initiated for the two-@@ stage RM@@ -@@ 2 rock@@ et in the B@@ le@@ dow@@ sky Des@@ ert.
The rock@@ et was 1.@@ 4 met@@ res in leng@@ th and weigh@@ ed approximately 1@@ 1.5 k@@ g.
A further development model was designed for real scientific work - the RM@@ -@@ 34 rock@@ et was to reach 14@@ .@@ 5 k@@ m and be t@@ asked with monitoring high al@@ titu@@ de win@@ ds.
Of course, in 196@@ 2 further research was stopp@@ ed.
The successor to the R@@ M rock@@ et type was the Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 1 rock@@ et, developed from 196@@ 2 to 196@@ 5.
The rock@@ et was designed as a two-@@ stage rock@@ et, with a total leng@@ th of 5@@ 10 c@@ m and a launch weight of 3@@ 2.5 k@@ g.
Three models were developed (@@ desig@@ n@@ ated Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 1@@ A, -@@ 1@@ B, and -@@ 1@@ C), which differ@@ ed in the room available for scientific apparat@@ us.
In the Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 1@@ A rock@@ et, a space of 0.@@ 4 li@@ tre@@ s was available, Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 1@@ B had 0.@@ 34 lit@@ res, and Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 1@@ C had 0.@@ 6@@ 2 lit@@ res.
The maximum al@@ titu@@ de for all three models was 3@@ 7@@ k@@ m.
Between 196@@ 5 and 196@@ 8, the development of Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 2 was underway in the A@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tics Institu@@ te, with its first launch tests in October 1970@@ .
The Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 2 rock@@ et had a launch weight of 3@@ 80 k@@ g, and was capable of lifting a useful lo@@ ad of 10 k@@ g to a hei@@ ght of around 60@@ k@@ m.
Sub@@ sequ@@ ently built models were the Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 2@@ H and Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 3.
Pol@@ and@@ 's ad@@ mission to CO@@ S@@ PA@@ R (@@ Committee for Sp@@ ace Resear@@ ch@@ ) in 1960 should be men@@ tion@@ ed, as well as the appointment of a national CO@@ S@@ PA@@ R board two years later.
Poland also particip@@ ated in the Inter@@ ko@@ smo@@ s space programme for space research on Soviet artificial sat@@ el@@ lit@@ es, and in 197@@ 8, the Polish pilo@@ t Mi@@ ro@@ s@@ law Her@@ mas@@ z@@ ew@@ ski became the second inter@@ co@@ s@@ mon@@ aut after Vladimir Rem@@ kov@@ .
Abo@@ li@@ shing the legislation on public works is not the solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court aboli@@ shed the law on public works.
The resolution caused liv@@ ely public debate.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspec@@ tive.
Liber@@ ally oriented financial systems in the EU, just as those in the glob@@ alis@@ ed world, are based on the principle of an un@@ regulated economic competition.
Its effect means that individual financial entities and national economic systems are in a state of permanent conflict among themselves.
The cause is the principle of free trade and free, completely un@@ regulated movement of private capital together with un@@ controlled financial specul@@ ation.
D@@ ue to significant lab@@ our cost differences (@@ sal@@ ari@@ es) there is pressure on prices.
On this basis, it should be understood that when a supp@@ lier tries to compete in a commercial tender by impor@@ ting cheap goods, "the ru@@ g is pul@@ led@@ " from under the competi@@ tion@@ 's prices to capture a greater market share and, in this way, increase its own prof@@ its.
On a wider scale, this means most businesses must move production abroad, import cheap@@ ly from abroad, or close down. The result is high unemployment in countries where lab@@ our costs are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital is not bound by social responsibility, and therefore also not by the unemployment it caus@@ es, the social costs born by the state must necessarily increase.
The whole situation is bol@@ stered by the business@@ man@@ 's complete unwillingness to pay taxes, which would allevi@@ ate the economi@@ cal and social harm caused in the pursuit of prof@@ it.
The situation is so well known that there is no need for actual statistical data.
The ruth@@ less private capital practices create particular economic situ@@ ations, where the State in these countries is forced to enter in the mutual competition, aim@@ ing to arti@@ fici@@ ally lower the social standard of its own citizens in order to attract foreign investment.
In other words, governments stake their own citizens because of private capital while dis@@ regarding the drop in social standards.
This occurs chi@@ ef@@ ly in amend@@ ments to existing law.
The aim is to economically force the domestic population to accept prices dict@@ ated by private capital, especially in terms of sal@@ aries.
On one hand, this economic system of force, in case of long-term unemployment, on the other, restricted employe@@ e rights in the work@@ place.
This yields growing poverty and an increasing vo@@ id between the poor and the rich@@ .
In Germany there are already a host of food hand@@ -@@ out cent@@ res for the poor, who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages.
The number of these people is already in the milli@@ ons.
In the name of improving the competitiveness of the German economy, it commonly occurs that properly employed people receive such a sal@@ ary that the State needs to top it up to the minimum wa@@ ge.
Just such a scandal was revealed in the case of au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary staff in the Bundest@@ ag@@ .
The austerity measures for all the southern EU states will undoubtedly lead to the same situation, where people are pressu@@ red by a catastrophic drop in living standards to emig@@ rate as it was in the 19@@ th century, or to ek@@ e out an existence on star@@ vation wages on the edge of society, in the hope that the country will eventually see some foreign investment.
At this point we have to ask where this may come fro@@ m@@ ?
If it is to come from other EU states, then poverty is being shifted from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chin@@ ese, Indi@@ an, Brazi@@ li@@ an, Turk@@ ish@@ , Mor@@ occ@@ an, Egypti@@ an, and African lab@@ our is still at a fraction of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the Medi@@ a inc@@ ess@@ antly claim that the State may not participate with capital in its own economy, and that a controlled economy leads to economic ru@@ in.
Private capital cru@@ el@@ ly insists on the view@@ point that the State must not intervene in the economy.
Ther@@ eu@@ p@@ on, we should ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence, or whether it actually leads politics and thereby the whole country, for its own sel@@ fish end@@ s.
Here, the answer must be y@@ es.
The proof is the existence of the almost om@@ ni@@ pot@@ ent, and in all states, om@@ ni@@ present lobb@@ y.
The result is a desperate situation manifest@@ ing itself through corruption, through mutual benefits and legislation, where almost everything is crimin@@ al, but nothing is pun@@ is@@ hab@@ le.
In Germany the situation is such that state minist@@ ri@@ es, through lack of financial resources, contract out the dra@@ fting of laws to private law firms, who are basically connected with industry.
These laws are then approved in the Bundest@@ ag@@ .
Real power does not come from the people as the Western@@ -style constitu@@ tions claim@@ , but from strong financial organis@@ ations that look after their own interests.
It is clear that liber@@ all@@ y-@@ orient@@ ated democracies will now quickly reach a situation, as is described by Ap@@ pi@@ an in his work on the Roman Republic Crisis in the time of C@@ es@@ ar and P@@ om@@ p@@ ei@@ : "@@ The State was already long in complete de@@ generation and its offic@@ es taken by force.
With bri@@ ber@@ y, illegal acqui@@ sition of benefits, and with st@@ ones or s@@ wor@@ ds.
Bri@@ ber@@ y and corruption were ri@@ fe and un@@ hinder@@ ed, and the people would vote for a result which had been b@@ ough@@ t" ...@@ "@@ people with principles did not run for office, so on one occasion the whole debac@@ le meant the state went eight months without consul@@ s@@ .@@ ." ..@@ "@@ There was actually talk about the only answer to this terrible situation being auto@@ cra@@ cy, and an en@@ er@@ ge@@ tic man should be elec@@ ted@@ ." Ap@@ pi@@ an had P@@ om@@ pe@@ i in mind, but it was C@@ es@@ ar who changed democracy for auto@@ cracy perman@@ ently.
The conclu@@ sion, just as in anti@@ qu@@ ity, the current society is built on un@@ sc@@ rup@@ ul@@ ous tenden@@ cies for personal gain without regard to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital in its present state is not able to understand the interests of society as a whole.
The outcome is now, as it was then, an unprecedented decad@@ ence of the elite with no attempts what@@ so@@ ever on deeper reaching reforms.
The caus@@ ality of the rise of the fasc@@ ist and communist regimes should therefore be sought in the misguided liber@@ alis@@ ation of the economic system in the 19@@ th and 20@@ th centuri@@ es.
The current state of affairs, when we consider the demise of those systems in fa@@ v@@ our of liber@@ alis@@ ed democracy as an inter@@ lu@@ de, can expect its next cy@@ cle.
The particularly catastrophic reality is that the current elite is completely ignoring the potential lost of hundreds of thousands of lives, humanitarian and social disaster@@ s, which we are already witn@@ ess@@ ing, as well as crimes against human@@ ity, as we are familiar with from ancient and modern history.
The aboli@@ tion of the law on public works is not the answer@@ , at least not in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, internationally as well as within Europe, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to pursue ways of lowering the popul@@ ation@@ 's living standards.
This pattern is thus system@@ ic.
To address this, there are targeted political and social reforms, which strengthen the stat@@ e's capital participation in the economy, increase the people@@ 's influence over the state and weaken the monopoly held by private capital over society in fa@@ v@@ our of the state.
Israel@@ : Chaos Lab@@ .
"@@ Nothing comes from violence and nothing ever co@@ uld@@ ," from St@@ ing@@ 's Fra@@ gi@@ le, where one of the main ver@@ ses from the refra@@ in is "@@ L@@ est we forget how fragile we are@@ ."
"@@ If my sons did not want war, there would be non@@ e@@ ," said the dying Gut@@ le Schn@@ ap@@ per@@ , wife of May@@ er Am@@ sch@@ el Ro@@ th@@ schil@@ d in 18@@ 4@@ 9.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza stri@@ p, as al@@ ways, has sp@@ arked a lot of reac@@ tion.
Some stand by Israel, arguing it has the right to self-@@ def@@ ence, and Palestinians are portra@@ yed as terror@@ ists, while others support the Palestinians, claiming rac@@ ism by the Israeli state, claiming that genocide is being committed against Palestinian Arab@@ s, and that Israel is a terrorist state.
I do not want to d@@ well, in these repeated perio@@ dic waves of kill@@ ing, on who is the trans@@ gres@@ s@@ or and who is the victim@@ , after all, today's inhabit@@ ants of Israel, including the self-@@ governing territori@@ es, were born into the current political situation, and did not live through the start of the violence.
I would like to offer the re@@ a@@ ders a pe@@ ek behind the scen@@ es, a look at wh@@ om@@ , most of all, this 9@@ 5-@@ year long tension is serving (@@ starting from Bal@@ four@@ 's declaration in November 19@@ 17@@ ) on this small piece of land in the Middle East.
Some of my though@@ ts are supported by available historical fac@@ ts, while others are derived from my own understanding of who, that is, which group of people is the main source of events in modern history.
Human history is in the first inst@@ ance about the struggle for power.
In every era we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napole@@ on.
What is not quite so apparent is whether these were the people, who had chosen their path indepen@@ d@@ ently, or whether behind their th@@ r@@ one stood someone who directed their actions towards a pre-@@ calculated goal.
We must accept that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated into the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of wealth and the power it ex@@ u@@ des could not happen in one gener@@ ation@@ 's li@@ fes@@ p@@ an.
Among these ast@@ r@@ onom@@ ically rich families, one stands out, which could be considered the p@@ up@@ pe@@ t master (@@ whether someone else stands above them, I am un@@ sure, but I would not rule it out@@ ) - the Ro@@ th@@ schil@@ ds.
Not much is written about them.
Under@@ stand@@ ably.
The first news agency (@@ Re@@ u@@ ter@@ s) they bought in the 90@@ 's of the 19@@ th century, in order to prevent their name being connected with acts of high crimin@@ ality, which appeared in their background and which always meant securing power, increasing wealth, or both.
They hold majority stakes in almost every central bank in the world, and against the countries, where they do not hold a stak@@ e, they are either w@@ aging or preparing for war (@@ before the assault on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after Iraq it was 5, after the overthrow of K@@ addaf@@ i 4 remain@@ ed, but in the mean@@ time Russia sub@@ mitted its central bank to the Russian Govern@@ ment@@ ).
W@@ ho@@ ever attempted to def@@ y this family di@@ ed.
Abra@@ ham L@@ inc@@ ol@@ n refused to ren@@ ew the status of the central bank to the Ro@@ th@@ schil@@ d Bank of America, and during the Civil War he began to issue his own (@@ that is state-@@ issu@@ ed) money and was assassin@@ ated in 18@@ 65 at the the@@ at@@ re.
J@@ F@@ K began issuing his own money and wanted to close the Fed (@@ Federal Reserve@@ ), and was killed in 196@@ 3, Congres@@ s@@ man Lou@@ is Mc@@ F@@ ad@@ den was pois@@ oned in 193@@ 6, after he had intended to su@@ e the Fed for causing the Great Depression of 192@@ 9.
Their thir@@ st for global power led in the years of 18@@ 5@@ 9 - 187@@ 1 to the form@@ ulation of a three-@@ world-@@ war plan by the fre@@ em@@ as@@ on leader of the 3@@ 3@@ r@@ d degre@@ e, Al@@ bert P@@ ik@@ e.
The first war was to remove the large monarch@@ ic state bodies in Europe, the second was to remove colonial rule, especially from Great Britain, and the third will reduce the world's population down to 0.@@ 5 - 1 billion people (@@ this number of sla@@ ves will suff@@ ice for their comfort and lux@@ ur@@ y, and will not use up so many resourc@@ es), the creation of one universal faith (@@ ec@@ um@@ en@@ ism is just an appeti@@ ser for this solu@@ tion@@ ), and finally the sei@@ zing of absolute power.
The metho@@ d, which the group of wealthy families with the Ro@@ th@@ schil@@ ds leading the way, employ is the in@@ stig@@ ation of crises, followed by the offering of a solution (@@ order ab cha@@ o - order from chao@@ s).
These solutions are fal@@ se, however, and always lead to a worse situation (@@ vi@@ de establishment of the Fed, so that the crisis of 190@@ 7 would not be repeat@@ ed@@ ).
Thus, having succeeded in assassin@@ ating F@@ erd@@ in@@ and, the Hab@@ s@@ burg h@@ eir to the Aust@@ ro@@ -@@ Hung@@ arian th@@ ron@@ e, in Sar@@ aj@@ ev@@ o thereby unleash@@ ing World War I, they destroyed ts@@ ar@@ ist Russia with the Bol@@ sh@@ evi@@ k revolution.
The First World War ended abrup@@ tly, milit@@ arily and economically un@@ substanti@@ ated, with German capit@@ ulation (the war was no longer needed to destroy ts@@ ar@@ ist Russi@@ a) and the central European powers of Austri@@ a-@@ Hungary were subsequently disman@@ t@@ led.
To facilitate the inc@@ ep@@ tion of the Second World War, they allowed bankers and politicians to create a lat@@ ent conflict situation by s@@ add@@ ling Germany with huge war repar@@ ations, thereby making a radic@@ alist example of the impoverished mass@@ es, it remained only to introduce a sufficiently convincing culpri@@ t and a leader with a simple solution, while also creating a multi-@@ racial Czechoslo@@ vakia with a strong German minority to pla@@ y, and indeed did, the role of a fifth colon@@ y, once the war had been ig@@ nit@@ ed.
At the end of the 19@@ th Cent@@ ur@@ y, the Ro@@ th@@ schil@@ ds in@@ stig@@ ated the establishment of the Zion@@ ist movement, one bran@@ ch of which stro@@ ve to form the Jewish State, seeking out an area of historic Ju@@ de@@ a, Jerusal@@ em, to make its capital (the Ret@@ ur@@ n to Zion@@ ).
The af@@ or@@ em@@ en@@ tioned Bal@@ four Declaration formed the basis for the mass immigration of Jews to Palest@@ ine, where the first conflicts began with the local Arab population.
Terror@@ ist attacks occurred on both sides.
World War II broke out, and whether Hitler broke free from the le@@ ash@@ , which international bankers were holding him on, or whether his actions were all part of the plan, is difficult to determin@@ e, ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the foundation to the world's acceptance of the Jewish Stat@@ e.
Israel was officially formed in 194@@ 8, and just as the war repar@@ ations for World War II were la@@ yed on Germany, the announcement of the State of Israel became the third war@@ 's ho@@ t@@ be@@ d.
Provi@@ ded the international bankers succeed, the Jewish N@@ ation, as with the second, will be the victims on the front line, now together with the Arab@@ ic - or more gener@@ ally, Muslim - population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge labor@@ ator@@ y, a source of dis@@ cor@@ d and chaos not only within the country, but on an international level (@@ just look at how strongly people are split into supporters and opponents of Israel@@ ).
Who is the wrong@@ -@@ do@@ er and who is the victim in the Palest@@ ine-@@ Israel conflict, where in@@ justice bre@@ eds in@@ justice in an endless cycle of violence, while everything began from the gre@@ ed of a few and their l@@ ust for global power@@ ?
Here, we must differenti@@ ate between Israel@@ 's general population and their leaders, because, just as it happens here, the international bankers introduce their own selection of candidates for people to vote for@@ .
Israel@@ 's current prime minister, Netanyahu '@@ the haw@@ k@@ '@@ , is a typical example of a fasc@@ ist politici@@ an, loyal to the international bank@@ ers, who does everything to in@@ stig@@ ate war with Iran, which would, due to its membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (@@ China, India, Russia, Pakistan, ..@@ .) lead to a greater threat of global conflict, and through its control of the Hor@@ mu@@ z Stra@@ it, where 20% of the world's oil must sa@@ il (the channel is only 2 miles wi@@ de@@ ), to the destruction of the world's economy.
In what light stand the words, spoken by David Ro@@ ck@@ ef@@ eller in 199@@ 4@@ : "@@ All we need is a major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Or@@ der@@ ."
The New World Or@@ der in their eyes is one of master and sla@@ ve.
A world where the rest of the human population serve the luxury of a handful of financial ar@@ ist@@ oc@@ rat@@ s.
A world, where each new@@ -@@ born is im@@ plan@@ ted with a chip@@ , which makes their existence completely sub@@ jug@@ ated.
"@@ He also forced every@@ one, small and gre@@ at, rich and poor, free and sla@@ ve, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his for@@ eh@@ e@@ ad, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark@@ , which is the name of the be@@ ast or the number of his nam@@ e.
If anyone has insi@@ gh@@ t, let him calcul@@ ate the number of the be@@ ast@@ ,
for it is man@@ 's num@@ ber. His number is six hundred and six@@ ty six@@ ."
Ar@@ go@@ : When things are at their worst - call Hollywo@@ od.
In November 1979, a mo@@ b of Islamic student demonstrat@@ ors took over the American emb@@ ass@@ y in Teh@@ ran and held 5@@ 2 diplomats ho@@ stage.
They were to be released in exchange for the over@@ thrown Sha@@ h Mohammad Rez@@ a P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi@@ , who fled after the revolution to the USA, which had actually supported his regime for several decades.
For the American administration the situation did not offer a positive solution - it could not throw the Sha@@ h over@@ bo@@ ard, because this would seriously jeopardi@@ se the trust of other allied countries.
The release of the ho@@ stages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the theo@@ cratic regime, could not be achieved.
This was a blow to the pres@@ tige of the United States, which was later compounded by the fi@@ asc@@ o of attempting to free the ho@@ stages by force.
The incar@@ cer@@ ated diplomats were finally released after 4@@ 44 days, following negotiations medi@@ ated by the Algeri@@ an government.
Their or@@ deal provoked a wave of solidarity and anti-@@ Iranian feelings at home.
The debac@@ le in Iran significantly influenced Jimmy Car@@ ter@@ 's loss with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Ar@@ go, directed by the actor Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck, re@@ counts one episode in this story, which brought America a small victory.
Just before the emb@@ ass@@ y was sei@@ zed, six employees escap@@ ed.
After some peri@@ pet@@ ei@@ a, they ended up in the Can@@ adian ambass@@ ad@@ or@@ 's residen@@ ce.
The CI@@ A, in collaboration with the Can@@ adian authorities, succeeded in getting them out of Iran, helped by an extra@@ vag@@ ant cover story - they left on Can@@ adian pas@@ sports as members of a film cre@@ w, who were surve@@ ying loc@@ ations for a sci@@ -@@ fi block@@ bu@@ ster.
A combination of gen@@ res
The plan, conceived by "@@ ex@@ fil@@ tra@@ tion@@ " exper@@ t, Tony Men@@ de@@ z, required the assistance of Hollywo@@ od.
For the story to be believ@@ ed, the film project was reported on in speci@@ alist maga@@ zin@@ es, press confer@@ ences were organis@@ ed, and the fic@@ ti@@ tious production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were, for a long time, kept sec@@ ret@@ ; the film draw@@ s on the memories of Tony Men@@ de@@ z.
Aff@@ le@@ ck@@ 's film is a peculi@@ ar mix of gen@@ res.
On one hand, there is a realistic inci@@ sive political thri@@ ll@@ er, and at the same time a "@@ cap@@ er movi@@ e@@ ," with small vic@@ tories and double-@@ cross@@ ing - another example would be Oc@@ e@@ an's Ele@@ ven.
The mood altern@@ ates in the film - on one side, sharp docum@@ entar@@ y-@@ style sequ@@ ences in Teh@@ ran (the ti@@ tle sequ@@ ence shows i@@ con@@ ic pho@@ tos from news of the time, rel@@ ating to the same events portra@@ yed in the film - there are no big differ@@ enc@@ es).
On the other hand, ligh@@ ter sec@@ tions from Hollywo@@ od, lac@@ ed with irony and a little exagger@@ ation.
Then there are sc@@ enes from the CIA head@@ quarters and other agencies - men in suits deb@@ ating the situation around meeting tab@@ les, in office cor@@ ri@@ dor@@ s, over the ph@@ one@@ ...
Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck has managed to res@@ tar@@ t his career in extraordinary sty@@ le.
The der@@ ided actor has become a respected direc@@ tor, and his acting is no longer the target of iron@@ ic com@@ ments.
Arg@@ o is his third big@@ -@@ scre@@ en movi@@ e, following his dark crime movi@@ e G@@ one Bab@@ y G@@ one (@@ 200@@ 7@@ ) and the thri@@ ll@@ er The T@@ own (@@ 201@@ 0@@ ).
It is also Aff@@ le@@ ck@@ 's first pic@@ ture, which does not take place in the direc@@ tor@@ 's hom@@ et@@ own of Bost@@ on.
The atmo@@ sph@@ eric feel in different loc@@ ations is one of the character@@ istic@@ s, which took his earlier fil@@ ms above Hollywo@@ od standards.
Aff@@ le@@ ck shows it in Ar@@ go, where Teh@@ ran is "@@ feat@@ u@@ red@@ " by Can@@ ada.
The best sc@@ enes of the film take place in the stre@@ ets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequ@@ ence of the si@@ ege on the emb@@ ass@@ y is impres@@ sively lu@@ ci@@ d, creating at once feelings of con@@ fusion and surprise, which come floo@@ ding in, as history suddenly takes a tur@@ n.
A similar effect is achieved by Aff@@ le@@ ck and his team in the fic@@ ti@@ tious sc@@ enes (the f@@ ake staff at the Teh@@ ran b@@ az@@ a@@ ar@@ ).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to tackle the issue that the story being told does not offer many n@@ ail@@ -@@ bit@@ ing sc@@ enes for the fil@@ m.
What little there is, is worked well, with some occa@@ sional em@@ belli@@ sh@@ ments to reality - these do not all come off so eleg@@ antly (the scen@@ e, where a looming crisis is aver@@ ted at Teh@@ ran air@@ port by a phone call in America, followed by a ch@@ ase on the run@@ way seems quite far-@@ fet@@ ch@@ ed@@ ).
Ar@@ go@@ 's weakness is its diver@@ gen@@ ce, which comes from the need to show too many events in too many plac@@ es.
Alan Ar@@ kin and John Go@@ od@@ man play their roles as the Hollywo@@ od assist@@ ants with great ch@@ arm@@ ; their charac@@ ters deserve more room@@ , and are not by far the only ones in this fil@@ m.
Aff@@ le@@ ck@@ 's film loses the dramatic pull a litt@@ le, it is a fil@@ m, which can be watched with reasonable interest, its production and retro@@ -style are ev@@ oc@@ ative of thri@@ ll@@ ers from the 70@@ 's.
It does not really cap@@ tiv@@ ate.
As a reminder of histor@@ y's particular ways and a testim@@ ony to how exagger@@ ated the views are on the all-@@ powerful all-@@ controlling secret services, this will do.

Among the latest nomin@@ ated absur@@ di@@ ties, for instance, is the recent decision by the European Court to uni@@ fy insurance premi@@ ums for men and women.
Until now, women were fa@@ v@@ ou@@ red in life insurance prices, because they constitute a lower risk for insur@@ ers.
"@@ Other un@@ believ@@ able ideas from the EU can be nomin@@ ated by anyone until the end of the year.
The actual voting will then take place until the end of February 201@@ 3,@@ " informed Nach@@ er.
Among the controversial EU regulations, we might include the mandatory addition of bio-@@ ingredi@@ ents to fuel@@ , which consequ@@ ently har@@ ms the environment, the ban on reliable mer@@ cur@@ y ther@@ mom@@ e@@ ters just because they contain a relatively small quantity of a toxic subst@@ ance, or the rules on the size of chick@@ en c@@ ages, which significantly raised eg@@ g prices this year.
The ban on the use of the term "@@ spread@@ able but@@ ter@@ " and the withdrawal of classic light bul@@ bs from sale had previously come under critic@@ ism.
First rate ban@@ an@@ as are to measure 14 cen@@ tim@@ et@@ res
The Union@@ 's machine often makes decisions under pressure from this or that commercial or industrial lobb@@ ying group, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by state or group of states@@ ' interests (@@ just as the Czech Republic is promoting the demands of its banks under threat of being vet@@ o@@ ed@@ ).
The lobb@@ y's interests were, for example, that ban@@ an@@ as of the highest quality should measure at least 14 c@@ m in the EU, and were not to display and "@@ anom@@ al@@ ous cur@@ v@@ at@@ ure@@ ."
The European Commission defended itself, saying that it was only harmon@@ is@@ ing existing dis@@ join@@ ted national standards, which complicated trad@@ ing.
Nor@@ ms rel@@ ating to fru@@ it and ve@@ get@@ ables have already been sof@@ ten@@ ed by the EU despite opposition from certain states, refer@@ ring to the food waste caused by the existing direc@@ tives.
One possible pri@@ z@@ e-@@ winner in the poll may be the last year@@ 's EU regulation according to which infl@@ at@@ able ballo@@ ons must be sold with a warning that children under 8 years of age may not infl@@ ate them without par@@ ental super@@ vision.
Here, the EU pointed to an American research, which indicated that, among other to@@ ys, ballo@@ ons are one of the main causes of child suff@@ oc@@ ation.
A similar restric@@ tion now applies to children under 14 years of age using party blo@@ wer@@ s.
St@@ range ideas are conceived at home too
Fair@@ ly absurd is the rule rel@@ ating to individual European officials - everyone in the EU, who holds an official po@@ st, may not use the term Mac@@ ed@@ onia due to it being a sensitive top@@ ic for Greece, and instead the ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m F@@ Y@@ RO@@ M (@@ Former Yugosla@@ v Republic of Mac@@ ed@@ oni@@ a) should be used.
The Bank@@ ov@@ ni@@ po@@ plat@@ k@@ y@@ .@@ com ser@@ ver in collaboration with the Liberal Economist Associ@@ ation, La@@ isse@@ z F@@ ai@@ re, also nomin@@ ated, aside from the af@@ or@@ em@@ en@@ tioned absur@@ di@@ ties, for example the Union@@ 's regulation on the volume of food provision stocks held in an EU member state.
The EU sti@@ pul@@ ated the maximum volum@@ es of food provi@@ sions, which may be present within the C@@ R on the day of our entry to the Union.
The Czech Republic there@@ after exc@@ ee@@ ded, for instance, the permitted volume of mus@@ h@@ room preser@@ ves, which incur@@ red a high penal@@ ty.
The poll@@ 's organis@@ ers were also impres@@ sed by the idea of paying certain countries because they do not have a coast@@ line, or the sugges@@ tion of alloc@@ ating funding for a request for fund@@ ing.
These ideas did not come from Brussel@@ s, however, but from Pra@@ gu@@ e.
"@@ We are han@@ dic@@ apped because we do not have the se@@ a.
We are asking the European Union for a re@@ fund@@ ," declared the minister for agriculture, back in autum@@ n 2004, J@@ aro@@ sla@@ v Pal@@ as (C@@ SS@@ D@@ ).
His argument was that there had been a good har@@ v@@ est of cer@@ e@@ als, and due to the so-called bu@@ y-@@ out interven@@ tions, the stat@@ e's war@@ eh@@ ous@@ es were full and were forced to expor@@ t.
The Czech Republic is further away from a por@@ t, so according to Pal@@ as the EU should be paying us hundreds of millions of Euro@@ s.
The European Commission finally met the C@@ R hal@@ f@@ way by organis@@ ing a tender for the purchase of cer@@ e@@ als from countries that do not have access to the se@@ a.
Fund@@ ing to subsidi@@ se funding requ@@ ests was offered to foreigners by the Ministry for Region@@ al Develop@@ ment@@ 's minister, P@@ av@@ el Nem@@ e@@ c (@@ US-@@ D@@ EU@@ ), specifically this was meant for making requ@@ ests for funding from Brussel@@ s.
EU@@ : B@@ iz@@ ar@@ re legislation is the exception
Regul@@ ations may well become the target of criticism among member states, but the EU's efforts at regulation, more effective oper@@ ation, and development of the entire Union deserve recogni@@ tion, according to a number of exper@@ ts.
A more important issue, according to exper@@ ts, is the drawing of EU funds on projects, which have hardly anything in common with strengthening the European integration, but which was pushed through by member states during a budget meet@@ ing.
Emo@@ tions fl@@ are among Czech@@ s when, just as other countries in the Union, the C@@ R must fight in Brussels for the right to particular lab@@ elling on its traditional products, in which it does not always succeed.
The Czech@@ s fought for six years with the Germans and Austri@@ ans to protect the lab@@ elling of their Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ cke t@@ var@@ u@@ z@@ k@@ y, however the tu@@ z@@ em@@ sky ru@@ m, whose tradition reaches back to the 19@@ th century here, had to be ren@@ am@@ ed tu@@ z@@ em@@ ak by the manufactur@@ ers.
The app@@ ell@@ ation of rum can only be given to products di@@ still@@ ed from can@@ e su@@ gar, and not su@@ gar be@@ et.
Car@@ l@@ s@@ bad w@@ af@@ ers, Po@@ h@@ ore@@ li@@ ck@@ y and Tre@@ bon@@ sky car@@ p, and Z@@ ate@@ c hop@@ s have been added to the official list of regi@@ stered products of the EU, alongside the world-@@ ren@@ owned fet@@ a che@@ ese and g@@ org@@ on@@ z@@ ol@@ a, German mar@@ zip@@ an from Lu@@ be@@ ck, and Par@@ ma ham@@ .
The EU's stam@@ p of protection can also be pro@@ ud@@ ly shown on Par@@ dubi@@ ce ging@@ er@@ bre@@ ad and H@@ ori@@ ck@@ y tu@@ bes@@ .
People want me to save the re@@ public, but I am an am@@ ate@@ ur, says O@@ kam@@ ur@@ a
Sen@@ ator, how does a person decide they want to run for Presid@@ ent@@ ?
This is not about me being a sen@@ ator or president.
If everything in our country worked without problems, then I would not be running for any po@@ st.
I cannot watch any longer the country having been ro@@ bbed over the past twent@@ y years, th@@ iev@@ es ro@@ am@@ ing about there and people@@ 's taxes and retirement age increas@@ ing.
I had no ambition to be a politici@@ an.
When I see something I do not lik@@ e, though, I try to find a solution to change th@@ ings.
Since I have already turned for@@ ty, and I am an independent non-@@ party man, I have no other choice to influence things but to stand for sen@@ ator or president.
You have already reached the Sen@@ ate, but shor@@ tly after that you are taking off for the Cast@@ le.
Are you not turning your back on those who voted for you in doing this@@ ?
I have been saying the entire time that I would fight for the Cast@@ le based on the results in the Sen@@ at@@ e's elections.
Lat@@ er, I added that if I were elected as sen@@ ator, I would be standing for president.
My goal, though, is not the po@@ st, the post is a tool to allow my vision to be re@@ alis@@ ed.
There@@ fore, I need the greatest influence, and the strongest mandate possible.
The trouble is not just that as a nation we swe@@ ar in the pu@@ b or at the televi@@ sion, but that we tra@@ mp@@ le any@@ one, who wants to try to change th@@ ings.
The Medi@@ a add to this, misleading the public, and mistak@@ ing freedom of speech with freedom to li@@ e.
For example, I was allegedly bri@@ bing repor@@ ters, or I was allegedly an advis@@ or of J@@ ir@@ i Par@@ ou@@ be@@ k.
L@@ et@@ 's talk about your vision.
You set out on your cast@@ le si@@ ege with a th@@ esis on the material and criminal responsibilities of politics, and a retro@@ active financial disclo@@ sure of assets over twent@@ y million.
You need to change the law for this.
As president, though, you do not have this power, and only the Senate as a whole may propose law@@ s.
How are you going to solve this@@ ?
When I lobbi@@ ed, as a citiz@@ en, for t@@ our guide work to be a free trade, it was successfully carried through@@ .
The problem is political squ@@ ab@@ bling - when someone comes with a good idea from the left or the right, it will be deliberately rejec@@ ted, causing del@@ ays for the public.
As an independent non-@@ party man, I stand a far better chance of gaining support from all parliamentary sides.
The advantage I hold is that without the political pi@@ ge@@ on@@ hol@@ ing or dog@@ mas I can take what is best for our country from any side, and apply it.
Do you see your@@ self as a person from the right, or the le@@ ft@@ ?
From the Czech view@@ point, it seems they tend to put me to the left.
For me, it just does not matter if it is a little to the left or right.
The important part for me is moving forward.
It is not about whether someone is from the left or right, I just want to bring people together.
I always support any good public solu@@ tions, even if they are put forward by the K@@ S@@ C@@ M or the O@@ DS@@ , and, in the same way, I will oppose bad ideas.
You get angry when someone calls you a populi@@ st.
Are you not con@@ fir@@ ming this with what you have stat@@ ed?
When you make a company business plan, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
You try to come close to it.
Some may call it populi@@ sm, but all the proposals I speak about are already working elsewhere, or they have been put forward by exper@@ ts.
But without the support of the Parliament you will be left with just slogan@@ s.
You will not last long in politics with that.
Or do you believe that if you walk among the public and talk with them, that you will succeed, say, in passing criminal and material responsi@@ bilit@@ y?
I have no alternative.
I need to convince politicians, repor@@ ters, and the public, and try to get them on my side, so we can put this through@@ .
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to ar@@ range a live television broadcast@@ , where I ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to pass a law on material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil serv@@ ants, jud@@ ges, and the At@@ tor@@ ney Gener@@ al.
And, as the case may be, they would need to explain why they did not want this.
When there is a strong figure to point out the issues, it just needs some pressure on the political scen@@ e.
T@@ ake for inst@@ ance the direct election of the president, it was achieved thanks to public pressure.
I will say f@@ rank@@ ly that I am an am@@ ate@@ ur, I am not a geni@@ us or an intellectu@@ al.
I am looking for allies to share my opini@@ ons and vision.
I have just started out in politics, and I am looking for a majority support for my agenda.
I will try to make things progress, but it if does not work out, in six years I will fin@@ ish and return to the private sector.
It sounds a little like O@@ kam@@ ur@@ a is trying to save the Czech Republic@@ .
I am no sa@@ vi@@ our@@ .
I know that alone I will not achieve anything, so I have asked acqu@@ ain@@ t@@ ances, whether they would run for the sen@@ ate.
I went to Radi@@ m J@@ anc@@ ura@@ , who declined due to his work@@ lo@@ ad.
So I, at least, support investig@@ ative journ@@ alist, J@@ ana L@@ or@@ en@@ co@@ va, who un@@ covered frau@@ dul@@ ent activity with light heating oil.
I put my@@ self forward, because people are really dis@@ con@@ tent@@ ed, but now I have my doub@@ ts.
Six@@ ty perc@@ ent of people did not go to vote, and those who did mostly voted for leaders of the establish@@ ment.
In the sen@@ ate, there are only two indepen@@ d@@ ents, including me.
People have voted for a sen@@ ate that will make it difficult to enforce changes.
Nonetheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of may@@ ors or regional coun@@ cil presid@@ ents.
Are you considering having your own par@@ ty@@ ?
I have not considered it yet, because I have neither the time to veri@@ fy that every party member has a clean background, nor the money to do it.
I have no money even for a presidential campaign, my transparent account holds just 20 thous@@ and.
You have no money@@ ?
You are talking about financial disclo@@ sur@@ es, but what is your@@ s lik@@ e?
I estimate my private assets to be around 60 million.
In Pra@@ gu@@ e, I have land worth around 25 million, an apar@@ tment worth ten million, another apar@@ tment worth eight million, an ar@@ t@@ work collection worth around ten million, an A@@ st@@ on Martin worth 3.@@ 5 million, a S@@ ko@@ da Super@@ b worth a million, and I have a few million in my accoun@@ t.
I have the A@@ st@@ on Mar@@ tin@@ , by the way, because it was my dream as a bo@@ y - I always lik@@ ed James B@@ ond, who drove the car@@ , was g@@ all@@ ant with women and also fought against evil and vil@@ la@@ in@@ y.
You drive an A@@ st@@ on Mar@@ tin@@ , have assets worth 60 million, but you have no money for a campaig@@ n?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you are not keen on putting your own money into it.
This does not inspire much confidence.
I do not have 15 million for a campaign.
Should I take out a lo@@ an@@ ?
I have already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I do not have any sponsor@@ s is evidence that there is no real interest in my programm@@ e.
I have no obligation to pay for my own campaign.
The expenditure on my campaign is basically covered by the pay I will be receiving as a sen@@ ator@@ .
However, I would not be able to live on it, for instance, I could not pay for my son@@ 's English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If I were only interested in making money, I would not be standing for election.
So you will still be in business so that you can make a liv@@ ing?
Di@@ d you not say you would be putting this on hol@@ d?
This depends on the rate of pa@@ y.
As I promis@@ ed, my activities have been parti@@ ally reduc@@ ed.
For example, my deputy is taking over as the CEO of the travel agency in spr@@ ing.
People would like me to be a Sam@@ ar@@ it@@ an, who sa@@ ves the Republic@@ .
But I must also live off someth@@ ing.
As a business@@ man, what would you usually make month@@ ly@@ ?
Two hundred to 400 thous@@ and, which I still do.
And if I became president, then I would end my business activity.
The full inter@@ view can be read in Sat@@ ur@@ da@@ y's issue of Pra@@ vo@@ .
The M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V architec@@ ts prove that true advent@@ ures are not just in the head - drawing on the example of Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse and the recently er@@ ec@@ ted Büch@@ er@@ berg (@@ literally "@@ book moun@@ tain@@ "@@ ) - 2 pho@@ tos
"@@ I think the building is f@@ un, looks fut@@ uri@@ stic and ultimately provides something interesting to look at@@ ," said Lis@@ ette Ver@@ ha@@ ig, a pas@@ ser@@ -@@ by at the road@@ -@@ side.
And Ste@@ f@@ an S@@ per@@ mon@@ , IT techni@@ cian in a major firm based near@@ by comment@@ ed: "@@ It@@ 's definit@@ ely a thing of beau@@ ty, the build@@ ing@@ ."
However, I do wonder why people would need another li@@ br@@ ary in this day and age.
Everyone has the Internet, an i@@ P@@ ad and e@@ Bo@@ ok@@ s.
No@@ -@@ one goes into one of these old-@@ style li@@ br@@ aries voluntar@@ ily nowad@@ ays, or am I wrong@@ ?
Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ is@@ se, a sle@@ ep@@ y town outside the g@@ ates of Ro@@ t@@ ter@@ dam@@ , which barely mer@@ its a visi@@ t, is a special record@@ -@@ hol@@ der.
The 8@@ 0,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ res@@ ident municip@@ ality has the lowest liter@@ acy rate in the whole of the Nether@@ lands.
In order to counter@@ act this as@@ in@@ ine situation, the decision was made a number of years ago to make a contribution towards general education and to re@@ create the seven fic@@ ti@@ tious brid@@ ges that feature on the Euro no@@ tes as pre@@ tt@@ y, pain@@ ted reinforced concrete min@@ iat@@ ures.
The success of the education offensive was limited.
And so the city fa@@ thers acknowledged that there was only one way to become master over the statisti@@ c@@ s: a li@@ br@@ ary had to be buil@@ t@@ !
Win@@ y Ma@@ as of the Ro@@ t@@ ter@@ dam@@ -based architec@@ tural firm M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V@@ , master of au@@ d@@ aci@@ ous bar char@@ ts and produc@@ er of hum@@ or@@ ous and often cynical build@@ ings, took the project on with his custom@@ ary compo@@ sure, and turned up at the competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a gr@@ in on his face.
And with the jud@@ ging panel still looking at him with be@@ wil@@ der@@ ment, shr@@ ug@@ ging their shoul@@ ders, the imper@@ tin@@ ent Ma@@ as st@@ acked his chosen pro@@ ps by order of size to form a p@@ y@@ ra@@ m@@ id and ro@@ unded off his pres@@ entation - now su@@ it@@ ably backed up with action - with the wor@@ d@@ s: "@@ De@@ ar Muni@@ cip@@ alit@@ y@@ !@@ "
So this is my sugges@@ tion for the Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse Bo@@ ok Mo@@ un@@ tain - for the so-called Bo@@ ek@@ en@@ berg@@ !
N@@ ine years later, the 30-@@ milli@@ on-@@ euro moun@@ tain has been lifted up.
It is part of a re@@ vit@@ alis@@ ation project, which also includes an underground car par@@ k, a super@@ market, a post office and a small number of ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent apar@@ tment buil@@ dings and ter@@ rac@@ ed hous@@ es, with a total of 50 d@@ well@@ ings.
At the beginning of November, the Büch@@ er@@ berg was awar@@ ded second place in the "@@ B@@ est Li@@ br@@ ary of N@@ L 201@@ 2@@ " competition.
In addition, the project is also nomin@@ ated for the Dutch National Wo@@ od A@@ ward 2012.
Thus, the fac@@ eless sm@@ all-@@ town re@@ tor@@ t, that until now had nothing more to offer than a post-@@ modern ped@@ est@@ ri@@ an area and a stun@@ n@@ ingly ug@@ ly town h@@ all, behind whose white fac@@ a@@ des one would expect to find a da@@ ir@@ y plant, has been bol@@ stered by a piece of contemporary architec@@ ture.
First and foremost, however, Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse now has its first public cultural building in the history of its exist@@ ence.
The long jour@@ ney to the book
The first impres@@ sion@@ : the El@@ dor@@ ad@@ o of books beneath a che@@ ese dom@@ e.
There is in fact a lift that clim@@ bs through the cent@@ re of the moun@@ tain mas@@ si@@ f, however, the true jo@@ ys of space and literat@@ ure are revealed when sc@@ aling the to@@ po@@ graph@@ y on foo@@ t.
The inter@@ ior space, g@@ la@@ zed through@@ out, is bright and open, the fired clin@@ ker flo@@ ors and the eleg@@ ant street l@@ amp@@ s speak the un@@ mistak@@ able language of a public town squar@@ e.
The urban ambi@@ ance is perfec@@ t.
You are already on the look@@ out for a par@@ k ben@@ ch, a do@@ g, and boys and girls playing foot@@ b@@ all.
And everywhere there are book@@ s, book@@ s, book@@ s.
"@@ Nor@@ m@@ ally book shel@@ ves run along the fac@@ a@@ de, and in the cent@@ re there is a large, dark space, which is usually un@@ pleas@@ ant and im@@ person@@ al@@ ," says Win@@ y Ma@@ as.
We turned the classical sp@@ ati@@ al conf@@ ig@@ u@@ ration on its head and turned the reading area inside out.
The inter@@ ior of the Büch@@ er@@ berg is cle@@ ver@@ ly us@@ ed: in the cent@@ re there are offic@@ es, an Internet li@@ br@@ ary, a ch@@ ess club@@ , an environmental cent@@ re and the central technical support room@@ .
One particularly special feature are the black book shel@@ ves, which simultaneously act as wall cl@@ add@@ ing, par@@ ap@@ ets and rail@@ ings for the st@@ air@@ way.
The appear@@ ance, feel and sc@@ ent are foreig@@ n.
Even di@@ e-@@ hard architec@@ ts and construction engineers sh@@ ake their heads at the unknown construction materi@@ als.
"@@ Here we wanted to work with recy@@ cl@@ able materi@@ al@@ s@@ ," explained Jo@@ op Tro@@ ub@@ or@@ st, Project Manager for the Muni@@ cip@@ ality of Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ is@@ se, on request of the Stand@@ ar@@ d.
And thus one day we st@@ umb@@ led across a su@@ itable waste product used in agriculture, on a Fri@@ sian farm@@ .
For many years, milli@@ met@@ re-@@ th@@ ick artificial fabri@@ c has been used in green@@ houses and fields in the Netherlands as a base lay@@ er.
It is in@@ expensive and sa@@ ves time.
The thin tex@@ tile la@@ sts for two seas@@ ons and is then dis@@ posed of as bulk wa@@ ste.
For the li@@ br@@ ary, the fabri@@ c was - for the first time in these quanti@@ ties - pressed into four@@ -@@ cen@@ tim@@ et@@ re-@@ th@@ ick boar@@ ds.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Land@@ b@@ ou@@ w plas@@ tic (@@ K@@ L@@ P) changes col@@ our to a dark@@ , homo@@ gene@@ ous and robust materi@@ al, that sm@@ ells like a mix@@ ture of new car sm@@ ell and the sm@@ ell of train@@ ers.
After 10@@ 5 steps you have reached the summit@@ .
At the end of the 500@@ -@@ me@@ ter-@@ long jour@@ ne@@ y, you are rewar@@ ded in the Liter@@ at@@ ure C@@ af@@ é@@ , not only with a fantas@@ tic view of the city, but also with Dutch cro@@ qu@@ ett@@ es and pot@@ ted fic@@ us tre@@ es.
These provide atmosp@@ here, but most importantly, regulate the air hum@@ idi@@ ty in the liter@@ ary moun@@ tain ran@@ ge.
Don@@ ations for the new sou@@ l
"@@ You would hardly believe it, but this build@@ ing, in sp@@ ite of the many gl@@ ass pan@@ els, is a show@@ case project in the area of ec@@ olog@@ y@@ ," said Tro@@ ub@@ or@@ st.
It is he@@ ated and cool@@ ed using ge@@ other@@ mal he@@ at.
Although the Büch@@ er@@ berg has a gl@@ ass co@@ ver, the su@@ n only sh@@ ines only brief@@ ly into the inter@@ i@@ or, even on sun@@ n@@ y days.
The bro@@ ad, lam@@ inated wo@@ od g@@ lu@@ e be@@ ams posi@@ tioned at righ@@ t-@@ ang@@ les to the gl@@ ass fac@@ a@@ de, provide sh@@ ade and absorb the majority of the sun@@ light.
The in@@ door temperature is very pleas@@ ant.
The rest is taken care of by fully automatic roll@@ er blin@@ ds.
Ste@@ f@@ an S@@ per@@ mon@@ , initially a sc@@ ep@@ tic of the IT sector, has already vent@@ ured into the new li@@ br@@ ary.
Lis@@ ette Ver@@ ha@@ ig has also visited alread@@ y.
So too has T@@ C@@ M-@@ teach@@ er, C@@ yn@@ th@@ ia Bo@@ gar@@ de, who even ref@@ ers to the Bo@@ ek@@ en@@ berg as Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse@@ 's "@@ long over@@ due soul@@ ."
The reason@@ : At the in@@ augu@@ ration just a few weeks ago, every citizen was invited to don@@ ate a book from h@@ is@@ /@@ her personal collec@@ tion.
This was, for the time bein@@ g, to fill the op@@ tical gaps in the not yet fully stock@@ ed li@@ br@@ ary - currently there are 70@@ ,000 it@@ em@@ s.
The concept has been a success.
The shel@@ ves are full to capacity.
"@@ Nothing is worse than a half-@@ empty li@@ br@@ ar@@ y@@ ," said archit@@ ect Win@@ y Ma@@ as.
"@@ I think that, thanks to our inv@@ it@@ ation, every res@@ ident now has a certain bond with this new build@@ ing.
Everyone knows that their book is part of the build@@ ing.
Even if it@@ 's just for dec@@ or@@ ation.
As such@@ , M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V have succeeded in ma@@ stering the master discipline that speci@@ alist j@@ arg@@ on ref@@ ers to as the formation of identity.
Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse has written liter@@ ary history.
Ho@@ wever young and un@@ educated it may be.
This is ultimately a starting point for identity.
S@@ z@@ abo@@ : "@@ Germans must play a greater ro@@ le@@ "
In the vote on the incorpor@@ ation of Palest@@ ine, Germany ab@@ stain@@ ed from vo@@ ting.
According to Ste@@ phen S@@ z@@ ab@@ o, Exper@@ t in US-@@ European relations, in so doing Berlin is wal@@ king a thin diplomatic line.
Deutsche Wel@@ le: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially sign@@ alled that it would vote against the Palestini@@ ans@@ ' application for obser@@ ver status within the United Nation@@ s.
However, Berlin subsequently ab@@ stain@@ ed from vo@@ ting.
Wh@@ y?
Ste@@ phen S@@ z@@ abo@@ : Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, however, due to their special relationship with Israel, Germany must be cau@@ ti@@ ous.
At the same time, however, I do not believe that it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - albeit without being too critical of Israel.
During the upri@@ sing in Libya in March 2011, Germany lik@@ e@@ wise ab@@ stain@@ ed from vo@@ ting, when it came to establishing a no-@@ fly zone.
This was ultimately implemented by NATO.
Does Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position when it comes to important international affair@@ s?
Yes, it does.
That is because it has just re@@ organis@@ ed its foreign policy, indeed moving away from a policy that was, so to spe@@ ak, managed by the USA, in fa@@ v@@ our of a German foreign policy.
This situation is aggrav@@ ated by the fact that the Europeans do not have a coherent and standar@@ dis@@ ed policy.
The Germans thus find themselves caught between two fron@@ ts.
It is expected of them that they play a more independent role, yet this is something that they are not accustomed to.
I believe that they are still finding their way in this role, but they are en route to a "@@ more normal@@ " foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to that of France, or Great Britain.
So what specifically does a "@@ normal@@ " foreign policy ent@@ ail@@ , from a German perspec@@ tiv@@ e?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions on international matters, which are independent of those of the USA or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, that is, by export and its relations with certain regions such as Russia, China or the Ne@@ ar East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Ha@@ ve these economic interests had an influence on their attitude towards the Ne@@ ar East conflict and their voting in the UN@@ ?
On the one hand, Germany has major revenue markets in the Ne@@ ar East, and particularly in the Gulf States.
There@@ fore it must be careful not to aff@@ ront the public, but also the elite in the Arab@@ ic countries.
In any case, this plays a role.
However, I wo@@ uld@@ n't want to as@@ cri@@ be too much weight to this. This is not an entirely one-@@ si@@ ded relationship.
Nonetheless, it does play an important role in Germany's consider@@ ations.
H@@ as Germany damaged its relations with the USA, by ab@@ stain@@ ing to vote on important decisions, such as the vote on Palest@@ ine@@ ?
I think that in Europe, and even in the USA, a great understanding for the German position prevail@@ s.
There@@ fore I do not think that this was as dramatic a frac@@ ture as was the case in the matters regarding Liby@@ a.
Perhaps it will even earn Germany a certain degree of respec@@ t.
After all, it signals that the country must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be consider@@ ed.
In Europe there are diverse opini@@ ons regarding the Palestinian initi@@ ative.
The USA, on the other hand, have spoken out clearly in fa@@ v@@ our of a vet@@ o.
Are there differences of opinion between the USA and the many European nation@@ s?
D@@ ue to the American domestic policy, these differences have always exist@@ ed.
I think that sec@@ ret@@ ly, the government under Obama actually has a great deal of understanding for the European situation.
However, due to the political situation here, the government is naturally unable to voice this position public@@ ly.
It is my belief that the actual differences in opinion are not so vast as they always appe@@ ar.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjah@@ u, Obama is really not quite so enth@@ used by Netanj@@ ahu@@ 's policies.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand, and the position of its most important partners in the EU on the other@@ ?
I think that this is precisely what makes things so difficult for the German@@ s.
It would of course be a little simpl@@ er for the Germans if there were a coherent and standar@@ dis@@ ed European policy, which is currently not the case.
Th@@ us they are unable to be part of a wider authority and must instead drive matters forward from their own position.
This is precisely what they are doing with the Euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take on a leading role in ur@@ ging Europe towards a standar@@ dis@@ ed European position.
This is, of course, no simple task for Germany, on account of its relations with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive subjec@@ t.
Yet I do think that Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany view itself as playing the role of an important international player - does Germany actually want to assume a leading ro@@ le@@ ?
Or does Germany still find leadership roles difficul@@ t?
Germany is still not used to it, the country continues to be un@@ comfortable and, for obvious reasons, still finds it difficult to play a more prominent role.
If we look at the Euro crisis for example, every time that Germany assumes a more prominent role, various anti-@@ German feelings become appar@@ ent.
This does not make matters simple for the German@@ s.
This is actually the same old problem: one does not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this st@@ ance, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be rec@@ ep@@ tive to the most diverse of neigh@@ bo@@ urs and opini@@ ons, and this is not easy.
The influence of the USA over European politics is continu@@ ally diminish@@ ing, yet the EU is currently not feeling this vacu@@ um, so who is fill@@ ing the gap@@ ?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like it, even if it is un@@ comfortable and makes them even more unpopular - c@@ '@@ est la vi@@ e@@ !

"@@ Br@@ and protection@@ " in China@@ : When P@@ um@@ a and Ar@@ man@@ i suddenly become Chinese
Ar@@ man@@ i is a world-@@ famous br@@ and, Pol@@ o R@@ al@@ ph Lau@@ ren lik@@ ewi@@ se.
However, what is Ar@@ man@@ i P@@ olo@@ ?
Behin@@ d this name hi@@ des a fully officially regi@@ stered brand in China, however, one that has nothing what@@ so@@ ever to do with the original companies.
Nonetheless, it is enjo@@ ying protection, provided the actual cre@@ ators of the names do not su@@ e.
And even then it is not clear whether they will have any rights.
"@@ It is becoming increasingly more difficult for foreigners to protect their br@@ ands in China@@ ," said Thomas Patt@@ lo@@ ch, lawy@@ er within the Tayl@@ or W@@ essing law fir@@ m, who speci@@ ali@@ ses in cop@@ y@@ right inf@@ rin@@ gement in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my des@@ k.
All the cop@@ y@@ c@@ ats require are a few additional let@@ ters in order that they can regi@@ ster their br@@ and@@ s.
Th@@ us Gu@@ cc@@ i simply becomes Lu@@ -@@ Gu@@ c@@ ci@@ , Pra@@ da-@@ Kn@@ y is regi@@ stered in place of Pra@@ da.
German companies are also '@@ leg@@ all@@ y@@ ' co@@ pi@@ ed in this mann@@ er, such as manufactur@@ er of spor@@ ting appar@@ el, Pu@@ ma.
Patt@@ lo@@ ch op@@ ens a f@@ ile containing regi@@ stra@@ tions with the tra@@ dem@@ ark office in Pek@@ ing.
On 14 September 2010 a Chinese company cop@@ y@@ righ@@ ted the brand name Z@@ eg@@ na D@@ F P@@ um@@ a there, an ali@@ as that also helps itself to the name of fashi@@ on re@@ tail@@ er Er@@ men@@ egi@@ l@@ do Z@@ eg@@ n@@ a.
The fact that the Chinese are world champi@@ ons in cop@@ ying and inf@@ ring@@ ing on intellectual property is well-@@ know@@ n.
In the major cities there are multi-@@ level depart@@ ment stor@@ es that sell counter@@ f@@ eit goods almost exclu@@ si@@ vel@@ y.
Patt@@ lo@@ ch@@ 's cases, however, are slightly differ@@ ent: on behalf of his cli@@ ents he takes action against the fact that Chinese companies can be granted the right to use a name by the tra@@ dem@@ ark office, fully offici@@ ally, which is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call this "@@ B@@ ang M@@ ing@@ pa@@ i@@ ," a passen@@ ger br@@ and.
The word is based on "@@ B@@ ang D@@ aku@@ an@@ ."
This ref@@ ers to women who lat@@ ch onto rich men.
The Chinese authorities are un@@ aware of any wrong@@ do@@ ing.
"@@ This har@@ ms business and we must fight against it@@ ," challenges Patt@@ lo@@ ch.
"@@ The brand is water@@ ed down, its uniqu@@ eness dis@@ appears - the image damage is enor@@ mous@@ ."
The financial losses and process costs of the affected bran@@ ches amount into the milli@@ ons, especially in the case of expensive flag@@ ship products.
According to information from market research company C@@ L@@ SA@@ , with a volume of 15 billion euros annually, China is the third largest market for luxury it@@ em@@ s, and the fast@@ est growing.
However, the del@@ e@@ tion of dubious ent@@ ries in the tra@@ dem@@ ark regi@@ stry are difficult to achiev@@ e, and cost a pretty pen@@ n@@ y.
The process can last for up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Patt@@ lo@@ ch reports of inst@@ ances whereby the court dismis@@ ses cases, because after a long period of time, the name to which the objec@@ tion is being raised has become a "@@ market re@@ alit@@ y@@ ."
If the compla@@ inan@@ t is un@@ luck@@ y, he may even have to pay the pla@@ gi@@ ar@@ ist money for having inf@@ ring@@ ed on his tra@@ dem@@ ark in China, said Patt@@ lo@@ ch.
Sometimes the law of the jung@@ le prevail@@ s here.
Fam@@ ous cases also rel@@ ate to graph@@ ic el@@ ements.
In 2009, Da@@ im@@ ler lost a legal battle with the construction mach@@ in@@ ery manufactur@@ er San@@ y, the company that recently acquired German concrete p@@ ump manufactur@@ er P@@ utz@@ mei@@ ster.
Even today, the Chinese company is therefore permitted to use an em@@ ble@@ m that resembles the M@@ erc@@ edes star@@ .
Vol@@ vo@@ -@@ purchas@@ er Ge@@ ely originally used a blu@@ e and white lo@@ go that resemb@@ led the BM@@ W lo@@ go@@ ; the dispute was arbit@@ rated and Ge@@ ely was forced to change it.
Fas@@ hi@@ on house L@@ ac@@ o@@ ste lost a suit in China against cop@@ y@@ c@@ ats from Hong Kong and Singapore, who were using the famous cro@@ co@@ di@@ le looking in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are un@@ aware of any wrong@@ do@@ ing.
The C@@ T@@ M@@ O tra@@ dem@@ ark office in Peking does acknowledge that there were bott@@ len@@ ecks in 2010 due to limited staff@@ ing and equip@@ ment.
In the past year, however, things reportedly "@@ returned to normal following this emergency situation regarding the work flow@@ ."
Th@@ us the stock of un@@ proc@@ essed appeal proceed@@ ings was reduced by 22 percent@@ .
Almost 5@@ 7@@ ,000 such cas@@ ed were clos@@ ed, 75 perc@@ ent more than in the previous year.
Nonetheless, there are still 8@@ 1,@@ 500 appeals waiting to be resolved in the office.
To remed@@ y this is very expensive
As is so often the case in China, the figures are im@@ pos@@ ing.
In the past year, more than 1.@@ 4 million applic@@ ations for tra@@ dem@@ ark protection were sub@@ mitted to the C@@ T@@ M@@ O@@ , almost one third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China, for the tent@@ h time in succ@@ ession, is the global leader when it comes to new tra@@ dem@@ ark applic@@ ations, informed the authority.
The same applies for the invent@@ ory of vali@@ d trade@@ mark@@ s, tot@@ alling 5.@@ 5 million in num@@ ber.
In 2011, 1.@@ 8 billion y@@ uan in fe@@ es were recei@@ ved.
P@@ ut simpl@@ y, this means that each application costs on average 1,@@ 2@@ 80 y@@ u@@ an, or 1@@ 60 euro@@ s.
To appeal against an application costs many times this amoun@@ t, as can be seen in the case of the German family business, Fre@@ u@@ den@@ ber@@ g.
For more than seven years, the group has been con@@ testing against a Chinese pla@@ gi@@ ar@@ ist.
The Germans did in fact manage to expose the comp@@ any@@ 's illegal manufacturing of co@@ pi@@ ed motor vehicle par@@ ts.
However, the cop@@ y@@ c@@ at still secured the Chinese rights to the Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg br@@ and.
This is something we missed oursel@@ ves, as family names cannot be protected in Germany, said Han@@ no W@@ entz@@ ler, Chairman of the Board of Management at Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg Ch@@ emical Speci@@ alities in Mun@@ ich@@ .
The C@@ T@@ M@@ O tra@@ dem@@ ark office then also dismissed the Mun@@ ich@@ -based comp@@ any@@ 's appe@@ al.
In the next two inst@@ ances, Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg was proven right, however the opposing party continues to contest the matter to this day.
You have to pay extremely careful attention.
The matter is now pending before the Supreme Cour@@ t.
W@@ entz@@ ler is confident that the matter will be brought to a positive conclusion and pra@@ is@@ es the profession@@ alism of the cour@@ ts.
However, he also say@@ s: "@@ The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerv@@ es@@ ."
The internal costs can barely be calcul@@ ated, the company arch@@ i@@ ve even had to look through centur@@ y-@@ old records in order to provide pro@@ of@@ .
Five years ago Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg un@@ successfully offered the opposing party a "@@ high six-@@ figure sum in euro@@ s" as sett@@ lement.
"@@ This shows how much this is worth to us@@ ," says W@@ entz@@ l@@ er.
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to sp@@ ill@@ ing over, back into Europe.
Par@@ ticul@@ arly if im@@ it@@ ators secure un@@ protected brand names there.
For example, a Chinese manufactur@@ er wanted to regi@@ ster the Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg la@@ bel for sho@@ es and lea@@ ther in Germany.
This is a business sector that the group had long vac@@ ated, yet nonetheless managed to prevent the regi@@ stra@@ tion.
"@@ You have to pay extremely careful atten@@ tion@@ ," says W@@ entz@@ l@@ er.
Both he and Patt@@ lo@@ ch adv@@ ise companies to be very careful when conduc@@ ting business with China.
It is not sufficient to rely on international tra@@ dem@@ ark rights, rather foreigners should also regi@@ ster "@@ every@@ th@@ ing@@ " that is in any way worthy of protection in China as well@@ ," said W@@ entz@@ l@@ er.
Other@@ wise costs can be much more expensive than the regi@@ stration fe@@ e.
In actual fac@@ t: if Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg were to loose at the final hur@@ d@@ le of its tra@@ dem@@ ark dra@@ ma, they would probably have to pay the opposing party lic@@ en@@ se fe@@ es for the use of their own nam@@ e, explained W@@ entz@@ l@@ er.
Or altern@@ atively we would be forced out of the market in the respective sector.
World AIDS da@@ y: St@@ om@@ p, s@@ ing, help
In Hei@@ del@@ ber@@ g, the Im@@ b@@ ong@@ i cho@@ ir is re@@ hear@@ sing - and in the S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and, AIDS or@@ ph@@ ans are de@@ ligh@@ ted.
The history of a link that over@@ comes far more than a distance of 8,@@ 7@@ 33 kil@@ om@@ et@@ res.
First of all, the st@@ amp@@ ing: co@@ w@@ bo@@ y boo@@ ts, bas@@ ket@@ ball sho@@ es, la@@ dies@@ ' pump@@ s and men@@ 's lo@@ af@@ ers attempt to find the beat on the par@@ qu@@ et flo@@ or, and quickly do just that.
O@@ ne@@ -@@ two-@@ three-@@ four@@ .
Only then do the voices of the sing@@ ers slowly s@@ well - al@@ to, bas@@ s, ten@@ or and sop@@ ran@@ o sur@@ ge, be@@ gu@@ ile and ha@@ un@@ t.
And F@@ ie@@ te Hop@@ f, the 2@@ 9-@@ year-old conduc@@ tor, almost rises up out of his sho@@ es as he brings the ens@@ em@@ ble together with his smoo@@ th, yet wild gest@@ ures.
It is Mon@@ day ev@@ ening and in the musi@@ c room of the Institute for Medical Psych@@ ology in Hei@@ del@@ berg the Im@@ b@@ ong@@ i Cho@@ ir are practi@@ sing a new son@@ g.
The fif@@ teen sing@@ ers, aging from 23 to 6@@ 9 years old, range from human gene@@ tici@@ sts to the mainten@@ ance man.
"@@ O@@ m@@ '@@ Ob@@ ani@@ " is by no means a simple piec@@ e, with each voice having a different tex@@ t, and in an extremely foreign language at that@@ : Zul@@ u, which is spoken by el@@ even million people in South Africa, Bo@@ ts@@ wan@@ a, Les@@ o@@ tho@@ , Mal@@ awi@@ , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and in parts of S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and.
Hel@@ ping others to help themselves
There are around 34 million people infected with HIV around the world, as according to the estim@@ ations of Un@@ aid@@ s, the United Nation@@ s' programme to battle AIDS@@ .
Of th@@ ese, 2@@ 3.@@ 5 million live in South Africa.
In S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and, there are 2@@ 45@@ ,000 AIDS or@@ ph@@ ans.
Meanwhile, more than 40 perc@@ ent of the population are HIV posi@@ tive.
The Vo@@ ic@@ es for Africa Association has found sponsor@@ s in Germany for 18@@ 0 AIDS or@@ ph@@ ans in the village of E@@ si@@ t@@ jen@@ i.
70 of these attend a secondary school@@ .
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can become a sponsor@@ .
This guarantees the child money for school, a school uni@@ form and a warm me@@ al each day in the Go@@ go Cent@@ re.
In Zul@@ u, Im@@ b@@ ong@@ i means stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller or wor@@ ship@@ per@@ .
In this region, no-@@ one can speak the B@@ antu language flu@@ ently, but they can sing it.
For almost ten years the cho@@ ir has been practi@@ sing son@@ gs in this foreig@@ n, '@@ soft@@ ' language, and now and then they bring them back to where they originally came fro@@ m@@ : the South of Africa.
For an 8,@@ 7@@ 3@@ 3-@@ kil@@ om@@ et@@ re flight away from Hei@@ del@@ ber@@ g, in the north west of the S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and Kingdom, lies the village of E@@ si@@ t@@ jen@@ i, which relies on the vo@@ cal power of the German cho@@ ir@@ .
For@@ ty perc@@ ent are infec@@ ted.
Around 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and stra@@ w hut@@ s, and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have par@@ ents, as they succum@@ bed to the HIV virus@@ .
In E@@ si@@ t@@ jen@@ i you get a small fores@@ had@@ ow of the illness from which all of S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and is suffer@@ ing: according to Uni@@ c@@ ef, the region has the highest HIV infec@@ tion rates and the lowest life expectancy in the world.
C@@ ir@@ cum@@ ci@@ sion, which has been proven to reduce the risk of contrac@@ ting the virus by half, is barely practi@@ sed by the population.
More than for@@ ty perc@@ ent of people in the S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and carry the immun@@ o@@ defici@@ ency virus@@ , and dying in you mid-@@ thir@@ ties is by no means rar@@ e.
On a group trip to Africa in early 2005, the Cho@@ ir visited the vil@@ lage, but first and foremost, the Im@@ b@@ ong@@ is saw many children on the stre@@ ets, lacking not only in par@@ ental care but in practically everything else as well@@ : food, clo@@ thing, education.
Without a school leaving cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate, there are barely any opportunities, particularly in a poor country.
Initi@@ ally it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school and enable him@@ /@@ her to have one warm me@@ al a day for a few euros per year.
However, just one year later, the cho@@ ir established the "@@ Vo@@ ic@@ es for Afric@@ a@@ " Associ@@ ation, which since then has been looking after the AIDS or@@ ph@@ ans in E@@ si@@ t@@ jen@@ i at an almost professional level.
Fac@@ ts on sex@@ ually trans@@ mitted infec@@ tions.
What are the most important sex@@ ually trans@@ mitted diseas@@ es?
B@@ ac@@ teri@@ al ST@@ Is include sy@@ phili@@ s, ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia and g@@ on@@ or@@ r@@ ho@@ e@@ a.
Common vi@@ ral ST@@ Is are HIV@@ , human pap@@ ill@@ om@@ a virus@@ es, her@@ p@@ es gen@@ it@@ ali@@ s and h@@ ep@@ ati@@ ti@@ s.
Cra@@ bs and sc@@ ab@@ ies belong among the parasi@@ tic ST@@ I@@ s.
Who are the main affected group@@ s?
Sy@@ phili@@ s and g@@ on@@ or@@ r@@ ho@@ e@@ a occur primarily in men that have inter@@ course with other men.
The Robert K@@ och Institute understands that at least four in five of all sy@@ phili@@ s cases reported in Germany are trans@@ mitted by means of sexual cont@@ act between men.
Among hetero@@ sexual adul@@ ts, ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia infec@@ tions, tri@@ ch@@ om@@ oni@@ asi@@ s, can@@ didi@@ asi@@ s (@@ fung@@ al@@ ), g@@ on@@ or@@ r@@ ho@@ e@@ a and human pap@@ ill@@ om@@ a virus@@ es are frequently occurring sex@@ ually trans@@ mitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among hetero@@ sexual adults in this country is relatively low@@ ; however, around 20 perc@@ ent of newly contrac@@ ted cases of HIV are found in this group@@ .
Among young people, ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia infec@@ tions are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surve@@ ys, three quarters of all infec@@ tions affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In this country, human pap@@ ill@@ om@@ a virus@@ es are also frequently found in young people.
How has the number of infec@@ tions develop@@ ed?
Not all sex@@ ually trans@@ mitted diseases are noti@@ fi@@ able.
According to the Robert K@@ och Institu@@ te, the number of sy@@ phili@@ s infec@@ tions has more than doubled from 1,@@ 6@@ 9@@ 7 cases in 2001, to 3,@@ 6@@ 9@@ 8 cases in 2011.
The number of newly contrac@@ ted cases of HIV has been on the decline since 2007.
In 2011 there were around 2,@@ 700 cas@@ es.
This is around one tent@@ h fewer than the previous year.
Wh@@ ich symptoms indicate a sex@@ ually trans@@ mitted diseas@@ e?
The infectious diseases can cause ul@@ c@@ ers in the gen@@ ital area, dis@@ comfort when ur@@ in@@ ating, di@@ schar@@ ge, lower ab@@ domin@@ al pain and bli@@ sters or war@@ ts.
However, often they cause no pain or any other symptom@@ s, thus remaining un@@ detec@@ ted.
How can you protect your@@ self@@ ?
Con@@ dom@@ s can reduce the risk of contrac@@ tion, however, they do not offer 100% protection.
This is because occasion@@ ally, the pa@@ tho@@ gens of sex@@ ually trans@@ mitted diseases can also be passed on via sme@@ ar infec@@ tions and close bodi@@ ly contac@@ t.
There@@ fore, first and foremo@@ st experts recommen@@ d that people with frequently changing sexual partners under@@ go regular exam@@ in@@ ations.
If diagno@@ sed ear@@ ly, the majority of ST@@ Is can be cu@@ red and long-term consequences avoide@@ d.
Through sponsor@@ ships don@@ ations and by no means least the funds that the cho@@ ir raises across the whole of Germany, the money all adds up.
"@@ In tot@@ al, we have already sent around 200@@ ,000 euros to E@@ si@@ t@@ jen@@ i@@ ," said An@@ net@@ te L@@ enn@@ ar@@ tz@@ , Chair@@ person of the associ@@ ation.
In the village itself, Z@@ od@@ wa D@@ lam@@ ini, a self-@@ assured and asser@@ tive wom@@ an, man@@ ages the money from Germany.
She makes sure that the or@@ ph@@ ans have good accommod@@ ation, for example with one of their grand@@ mother@@ s.
The Go@@ go@@ s, as the old la@@ dies are called in Zul@@ u, are the pillars of the vil@@ lage.
Some of them have up to 14 or@@ ph@@ ans living with them, providing them with a ro@@ of over their heads and making sure that the children get to their school classes p@@ unc@@ tually every day, in their school uni@@ form@@ s.
Anyone who does@@ n't have anyone left, arri@@ ves at the shel@@ ter with Kh@@ any@@ i@@ si@@ le, a single woman who ear@@ ns the same sal@@ ary from the association as the two co@@ ok@@ s who co@@ ok for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "@@ Vo@@ ic@@ es for Afric@@ a@@ " has established a se@@ wing school@@ ,@@ built two chick@@ en co@@ ops and, together with the American health organis@@ ation, P@@ S@@ I, organis@@ ed for many in the village to be tested for HIV@@ .
This is nothing to be taken for gran@@ ted, as is clearly the attitude towards illness throughout the entire country, the best way of keeping things under w@@ rap@@ s is if people are de@@ ad.
A king with 14 wi@@ ves
"@@ AIDS is an absolute tabo@@ o subjec@@ t@@ ," said An@@ net@@ te L@@ enn@@ ar@@ tz@@ , "@@ because it is associated with sexu@@ alit@@ y@@ ."
This is actually strange for a country in which the king officially has 14 wi@@ ves.
The last absolute mon@@ arch of sub-Saharan Africa, King M@@ s@@ wat@@ i II@@ I@@ ., is known for his excessive lifesty@@ le.
Pol@@ y@@ gam@@ y in place of democracy.
Among other factors, the fact that the HIV virus has spread quickly over the past number of decades can also be attributed to this officially sanc@@ tioned lifesty@@ le.
Another factor is the large number of migrant workers who carry the virus across the country.
There are free con@@ dom@@ s on every cor@@ ner, said An@@ net@@ te L@@ enn@@ ar@@ tz@@ , "@@ but they are hardly used.
The culture pres@@ cri@@ bes otherwise - fl@@ es@@ h to fl@@ es@@ h@@ ."
In order to promote the cultural ex@@ change, the Im@@ b@@ ong@@ i cho@@ ir travel@@ s through Southern Africa every two or three years and s@@ ings son@@ gs of mel@@ anch@@ ol@@ y, fighting spiri@@ t, confidence and black self-@@ es@@ te@@ em, which many from the southern tip of the black continent still know from the times of apar@@ thei@@ d.
A bus full of white people, who sing son@@ gs in a black language - this degree of recognition brings not only mor@@ ale and jo@@ y, but some gri@@ m@@ -@@ faced border soldiers even shed a few te@@ ar@@ s.
The jour@@ ney always leads to E@@ si@@ t@@ jen@@ i, where the sing@@ ers visit their spon@@ s@@ or children.
Even though you can barely find the small village on a ma@@ p, it is more than well-@@ known in the val@@ ley of the E@@ zul@@ wen@@ i Ri@@ ver.
"@@ G@@ o to E@@ si@@ t@@ jen@@ i, that@@ 's where the light is@@ ," say the people there.
And if you make the 8,@@ 7@@ 3@@ 3-@@ kil@@ om@@ et@@ re flight back to Hei@@ del@@ ber@@ g, to visit the stom@@ ping sing@@ ers in their re@@ hear@@ s@@ al room@@ , you@@ '@@ ll see that the light is there too.
M@@ essen@@ ger@@ : NA@@ SA discover@@ s ice on Mer@@ cur@@ y
The M@@ essen@@ ger probe has found evidence of ice on the planet Mer@@ cur@@ y.
It is thought that the ice cover may be up to 20 met@@ res th@@ ick@@ .
The US space agen@@ cy, NA@@ SA@@ , has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mer@@ cur@@ y.
Although the planet lies closest to the s@@ un, it does have fro@@ zen water - as shown in three studies published on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day in speci@@ alist maga@@ z@@ ine "@@ Sci@@ enc@@ e@@ ."
The M@@ essen@@ ger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the region of the planet that lies permanently in shadow@@ .
This is thought to be at east 30 cen@@ tim@@ et@@ res and perhaps up to 20 met@@ res th@@ ick@@ .
The water presumably came from com@@ ets or perhaps also ast@@ ero@@ ids that imp@@ acted with Mer@@ cur@@ y.
However, no-@@ one is lin@@ king the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the plan@@ et, said Chief Scienti@@ st for the M@@ essen@@ ger pro@@ be, Se@@ an Sol@@ om@@ on.
The temperature on Mer@@ cur@@ y can reach up to 4@@ 26 degrees Celsi@@ us.
That said, the findings could help explain how water and other building blocks of life reached other regions of the solar system.
Un@@ known to the majority of the Ear@@ th@@ 's inhabit@@ ants, there are pro@@ bes@@ , tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es and small robo@@ ts such as the P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x@@ , deployed to research the dep@@ ths of the univer@@ se.
From time to time, they trans@@ mit images to Ear@@ th@@ : small pe@@ ep@@ hol@@ es into the in@@ fin@@ ite expan@@ se.
This image comes from a cam@@ era developed by German researchers at the Ma@@ x Pl@@ anc@@ k Institu@@ te.
The eight plan@@ ets of our solar system, plus the d@@ warf planet C@@ er@@ es.
Like Pl@@ ut@@ o, which or@@ bits around the su@@ n behind Nep@@ tun@@ e, C@@ eres is not a planet according to the new definition of the term issued by the International A@@ str@@ onom@@ ical Union in 2006.
This image sec@@ tion from an inf@@ rar@@ ed rec@@ ording by the Spitz@@ er tel@@ es@@ cope shows a "@@ family portra@@ it@@ " of countless generations of star@@ s: the ol@@ dest stars are seen as blu@@ e do@@ ts, while more difficult to identify are the pin@@ k-@@ col@@ ou@@ red "@@ new@@ -@@ born@@ s" in the star delivery room@@ .
This star@@ -@@ forming region - rather un@@ roman@@ tically named W@@ 5 by scientists - was discovered by the Spitz@@ er tel@@ es@@ cope in the C@@ assi@@ op@@ ei@@ a con@@ stell@@ ation, at a distance of 6,@@ 500 light years away.
This sh@@ immer@@ ing g@@ low of a dying star was captured by NA@@ SA@@ 's Spitz@@ er tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e.
The don@@ ut@@ -@@ shaped ring consists of materi@@ al, e@@ jec@@ ted by the star in the process of dy@@ ing.
In the huge Tri@@ fi@@ d N@@ eb@@ ul@@ a, 5,@@ 400 light years away from the Ear@@ th, new stars are created from gas and du@@ st.
NA@@ SA@@ 's Spitz@@ er tel@@ es@@ cope shot this pho@@ to of the gal@@ ac@@ tic delivery room@@ .
The P@@ lei@@ a@@ des star clu@@ ster, also referred to as "@@ The S@@ even S@@ ist@@ ers@@ ," can be seen with the bare eye at nigh@@ t.
With the tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e, however, the c@@ olo@@ urs really come into their own.
In this inf@@ rar@@ ed pho@@ to, the H@@ eli@@ x N@@ eb@@ ula looks back at the obser@@ ver like a red ey@@ e.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aqu@@ ari@@ us con@@ stell@@ ation.
Its simil@@ arity with the continent resulted in this N@@ eb@@ ula acqu@@ iring the ti@@ tle '@@ North Americ@@ a@@ '@@ .
A combination of normal and inf@@ rar@@ ed photo@@ graph@@ y produced the spectacular c@@ olo@@ ur@@ ing.
This baby star could only be captured in its full beau@@ ty using the Spitz@@ er tel@@ es@@ co@@ pe@@ 's inf@@ rar@@ ed detec@@ tors.

Perhaps they are the rem@@ n@@ ants of a moon of Sat@@ ur@@ n, which dis@@ appeared without a tra@@ ce 4.@@ 5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharp@@ est pic@@ tures from the H@@ ub@@ ble tel@@ es@@ co@@ pe@@ : the Wh@@ ir@@ l@@ pool Gal@@ ax@@ y
Dep@@ ending on the c@@ olo@@ ur@@ ing, photo@@ graph@@ s of spiral gal@@ a@@ xi@@ es can become genuine works of ar@@ t.
The photo@@ gra@@ ph published by the European Southern Ob@@ serv@@ atory shows the Tri@@ fi@@ d N@@ eb@@ ula in the S@@ ag@@ it@@ tari@@ us con@@ stell@@ ation, several thousand light years away.
The name Tri@@ fi@@ d stems from the Latin word tri@@ fi@@ dus (@@ divided into three par@@ ts@@ ), as dark stri@@ p@@ es of d@@ ust divide the core of the birth@@ place of stars into three par@@ ts.
In the O@@ ph@@ i@@ uch@@ us con@@ stell@@ ation, ast@@ r@@ onom@@ ers have photo@@ graph@@ ed the signs of a co@@ sm@@ ic col@@ li@@ sion@@ : 400 million light years from the ear@@ th, the cor@@ es of two mer@@ ging gal@@ a@@ xi@@ es move rapidly towards one another, dest@@ ined to col@@ li@@ de.
This star birth was captured by the H@@ ub@@ ble tel@@ es@@ cope in the M@@ 8@@ 3 spiral gal@@ ax@@ y.
Anyone who does@@ n't like technical ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations may prefer to call it by its ni@@ ck@@ nam@@ e, the Southern Ca@@ ther@@ ine Whe@@ el.
The pho@@ to taken by the H@@ ub@@ ble space tel@@ es@@ cope shows a sec@@ tion of the I@@ ris N@@ eb@@ ula in the C@@ ep@@ he@@ us con@@ stell@@ ation.
The ne@@ bul@@ a, 1,@@ 400 light years away, consists of par@@ ticles of d@@ ust that are ten to one hundred times smaller than standard house du@@ st.
This image was put together from the X@@ -@@ ra@@ y images captured by various tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es.
It shows a ring of black hol@@ es, 4@@ 30 million light years away from the Ear@@ th.
This group of gal@@ a@@ xi@@ es, named Ar@@ p 27@@ 3, was pic@@ tured for NA@@ SA by the H@@ ub@@ ble space tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e.

Likewise, this star clou@@ d, connected to the Ro@@ set@@ te N@@ eb@@ ul@@ a, continu@@ ally produces new baby stars - 5@@ 000 light years away from the Ear@@ th.
In this bright sh@@ ining gal@@ ax@@ y with one small black hol@@ e, there exists no d@@ ust - only g@@ as.
Resear@@ chers presum@@ e that it only came into being shor@@ tly after the Big Bang@@ , when the uni@@ verse was compri@@ sed primarily of hydro@@ gen.
Our view of the univer@@ se: the most important tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es
The tel@@ es@@ cope is thought to have been invented in 160@@ 8 by H@@ ans Li@@ p@@ per@@ h@@ ey - even before G@@ ali@@ le@@ o G@@ ali@@ le@@ i used the de@@ vice to ob@@ serve the stars one year later.
Since then, the mir@@ ror@@ s in op@@ tical tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es have become increasingly large and the insights that they provide increasingly profound@@ .
For a period of 30 years, namely from 194@@ 7 until 197@@ 5, the H@@ ale tel@@ es@@ cope in the Pal@@ om@@ ar Ob@@ serv@@ atory near San Di@@ eg@@ o was the largest tel@@ es@@ cope in the world.
The mir@@ ror@@ , shown in the ima@@ ge, had a diam@@ eter of five met@@ res.

The inner work@@ ings of the Gra@@ n Tel@@ es@@ co@@ pi@@ o Can@@ ari@@ as on the Can@@ arian island of L@@ a Pal@@ ma are huge - the mir@@ ror alone has a diam@@ eter of 10.@@ 4 met@@ res.
The mir@@ ror of the Southern African Lar@@ ge Tel@@ es@@ cope in South Africa is seg@@ ment@@ ed - to reduce costs.
In sp@@ ite of this it achiev@@ es a diam@@ eter of around el@@ even met@@ res.
The dis@@ advantage of this in@@ expensive construction metho@@ d: the tel@@ es@@ cope is sec@@ ur@@ ely cl@@ amp@@ ed at its ang@@ le of inc@@ lin@@ ation and its movement is therefore limited.
The H@@ ob@@ by E@@ ber@@ ly tel@@ es@@ cope in Texas also has a fixed ang@@ le of inc@@ lin@@ ation.
What sets it apar@@ t: the high ligh@@ t-@@ gathering capacity.
This - in sp@@ ite of its compar@@ atively low mir@@ ror diam@@ eter - even mat@@ ches that of the world's largest reflec@@ tor tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es.
With the help of a radi@@ o tel@@ es@@ cope in A@@ reci@@ b@@ o (@@ Puerto Ri@@ co@@ ) researchers can listen for ext@@ rat@@ er@@ res@@ trial signals in spac@@ e.

This is home to the Ver@@ y Lar@@ ge Tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e, which lives up to its nam@@ e.
With its total of four mir@@ ror@@ s, the tel@@ es@@ cope can also focus on the medi@@ al inf@@ rar@@ ed spec@@ tru@@ m.
Like@@ wise to be located at the ES@@ O Ob@@ serv@@ atory in Chile, the European Extrem@@ ely Lar@@ ge Tel@@ es@@ cope is also being plan@@ ned.
Its main mir@@ ror is to sp@@ an a full 42 met@@ res and will be made from almost 1,000 mir@@ ror el@@ ements.

Until 2007, the two K@@ eck tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es at the Ha@@ wai@@ ian vol@@ can@@ o, Ma@@ un@@ a Ke@@ a, were the largest in the world.
They each have two mir@@ ror@@ s, each with a diam@@ eter of ten me@@ ters.
The K@@ eck Tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es are part of the Ma@@ un@@ a Ke@@ a Ob@@ serv@@ ator@@ y, which alongside the K@@ eck tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es, can look to the heav@@ ens with the help of the Sub@@ ar@@ u tel@@ es@@ cope and the IR@@ TT@@ F.
Another huge new tel@@ es@@ cope is also to be built on the Ma@@ un@@ a Ke@@ a, with a mir@@ ror diam@@ eter of thir@@ ty met@@ res.

However, the most important insights into space are provided by the H@@ ub@@ ble space tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e.
Since 24 April 1990 it has been suppl@@ ying images of distant world@@ s.
Since March 2009 the Ke@@ pl@@ er space tel@@ es@@ cope has been searching for extra@@ -@@ solar plan@@ ets, especially for any that may be inhabit@@ able.

Scienti@@ sts are assuming that ice also exists at Mer@@ cur@@ y's south pol@@ e.
However, there is no reliable data in support of this as the M@@ essen@@ ger or@@ bits around the plan@@ ets much closer to the north pol@@ e.
For decades, ra@@ dar measure@@ ments have indicated that there is ice on Mer@@ cur@@ y.
Thanks to the M@@ essen@@ ger probe that was launched in 2004, the first to or@@ bit Mer@@ cur@@ y, scientists can now be certain@@ .
D@@ rin@@ k but@@ ter on a daily basis - and live to 16@@ 8 years of age
In Southern Azerbai@@ j@@ an, many people reach bi@@ bli@@ cal ages.
There is even a mus@@ eum of lon@@ ge@@ v@@ ity.
A h@@ unt for evidence in the country in which 9@@ 7 years old is still compar@@ atively yo@@ ung.
In Southern Azerbai@@ j@@ an, many people reach ages that can almost be considered bi@@ b@@ lic@@ al.
There is even a mus@@ eum of lon@@ ge@@ v@@ ity.
A h@@ unt for evidence in the country in which 9@@ 7 years old is still compar@@ atively yo@@ ung.
The jour@@ ney through the T@@ aly@@ sh Mo@@ un@@ tains can be described as wild and roman@@ tic.
The min@@ i@@ bus rum@@ bles over the win@@ ding stre@@ ets, past den@@ sely wo@@ o@@ ded h@@ ill@@ s, ra@@ ging ri@@ vers and simple farm@@ hous@@ es.
Every@@ where is green and lus@@ h - you could be for@@ given for thinking you were in the Black For@@ est.
However, this is the deep south of Azerbai@@ j@@ an, and the border with Iran is just a few kil@@ om@@ et@@ res away.
This is the home of the Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an people group, the T@@ aly@@ sh, of whom not much is known except that they speak perfect Per@@ sian and Azer@@ i and live long lives.
The final stop is L@@ eri@@ k.
The small town is bur@@ sting with over@@ power@@ ing architecture from Soviet times, which does@@ n't fit with the pic@@ tur@@ es@@ que moun@@ tain landscap@@ e at all.
Touri@@ sts from Europe rarely come her@@ e; the jour@@ ney from Azerbai@@ j@@ an's capital city, B@@ aku@@ , is too ar@@ du@@ ous.
It takes eight hours to travel the 3@@ 23 kil@@ om@@ et@@ res, as too much of the route is just a single tra@@ ck.
The f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous wealth, for which the country has its oil in the C@@ aspi@@ an Sea to th@@ ank@@ , has not yet arri@@ ves here in the provinc@@ e.
Yet Pil@@ ata Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ ev@@ a (@@ 4@@ 8@@ ) is convinced that L@@ eri@@ k has what it takes to be a touri@@ st attrac@@ tion.
"@@ Bak@@ u became famous in May due to the Euro@@ vision S@@ ong Con@@ tes@@ t, and next year we are having a fes@@ tiv@@ al to celebrate the ol@@ dest people in the world@@ ," said Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ ev@@ a.
She is the Director of the Mus@@ eum of Lon@@ ge@@ v@@ ity, most likely the only of its kind in the world.
Here the lives of eight dozen T@@ aly@@ sh from the area who lived to older than 100 are docum@@ ent@@ ed. Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ ev@@ a points out a black & white photo@@ .
This here is my grand@@ father, he was 120 years ol@@ d.
At the age of 13@@ 6 he father@@ ed another chil@@ d.
However, the un@@ riv@@ alled star of the mus@@ eum is sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d Sh@@ ir@@ ali Musli@@ mo@@ v who is said to have lived to 16@@ 8 years ol@@ d.
Ho@@ wever no birth cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate exists to confirm this.
And given that the lon@@ gest confirmed li@@ fes@@ p@@ an was 12@@ 2 years of age, Musli@@ mo@@ v@@ 's claim seems extremely doub@@ t@@ ful.
"@@ He was born in 18@@ 0@@ 5, here in the region, and died in 197@@ 3,@@ " explains Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ ev@@ a.
The man married three times and had 23 children, and is said to have father@@ ed another daugh@@ ter at the age of 13@@ 6.
So did Sh@@ ir@@ ali Musli@@ mo@@ v mis@@ calcul@@ ate his age by a couple of decad@@ es?
But Rem@@ br@@ and@@ t Sch@@ ol@@ z, resear@@ cher on ag@@ eing at the Ma@@ x Pl@@ anc@@ k Institute in Ro@@ stock@@ , has also heard of people living to impressive ages in Central Asia.
"@@ A strik@@ ingly high number of extremely elderly people can also be found in some areas of China, in Japan or the Hun@@ za Valley in Pakistan@@ ," said Sch@@ ol@@ z, "@@ while there is also an extremely large number of very old men in S@@ ard@@ ini@@ a@@ ."
D@@ ue to lacking docum@@ ent@@ ation, however, there is no scientific proof of age, particularly as there are no birth regi@@ ster@@ s.
Mel@@ ted but@@ ter by the g@@ las@@ s, every day
However, the fact remains that the people of the region surrounding L@@ eri@@ k reach a bi@@ bli@@ cal age with striking regul@@ ar@@ ity.
There are currently 20 individuals older than 100 years of age.
So why do so many very old people live here in the sou@@ th@@ ?
The Azer@@ i travel guide F@@ ari@@ d Mu@@ gi@@ m@@ z@@ ade@@ h explains this as being due to the special T@@ aly@@ sh gene@@ tic@@ s.
In contrast, Mus@@ eum Director Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ ev@@ a believes that it is due to di@@ et.
Ho@@ wever the notion that the cal@@ or@@ ie@@ -@@ rich di@@ et of the T@@ aly@@ sh, who love me@@ at, bre@@ ad and especially da@@ ir@@ y products, and of whom many drin@@ k a gl@@ ass of mel@@ ted but@@ ter on a daily basis, could be considered healthy from a nutrition science perspective does not really seem plausible either.
Or is it the traditional way of life that keeps the people young@@ ? In C@@ en@@ gem@@ ir@@ an, a tiny settlement not far from the town of L@@ eri@@ k, lives Rub@@ ab@@ a M@@ ir@@ z@@ ay@@ ev@@ a.
At 9@@ 7 years old she is still compar@@ atively young for the area.
M@@ ir@@ z@@ ay@@ ev@@ a, who claims to have 14@@ 3 desc@@ end@@ ants, lives in a simple wo@@ o@@ den hous@@ e, which is typical of the entire Caucas@@ us region.
She si@@ ts on the flo@@ or with a but@@ ter chur@@ n, which she roll@@ s back@@ wards and for@@ wards ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly.
Eig@@ ht people live here under this ro@@ of, including one of M@@ ir@@ z@@ ay@@ ev@@ a's sons and a daugh@@ ter, both of whom have been grand@@ parents for some time.
There are also two small children running around.
In the kit@@ chen, te@@ a is prepared for the gu@@ est@@ s, which is served in typ@@ ic@@ al, bul@@ ging Ar@@ mad@@ u g@@ lass@@ es.
M@@ ir@@ z@@ ay@@ ev@@ a's white te@@ eth stand in perfect rank and fi@@ le, beneath her head@@ scar@@ f she conc@@ e@@ als long, dark b@@ lon@@ d pla@@ its, which her son pro@@ ud@@ ly reveals for us.
I have always w@@ ash@@ ed my ha@@ ir with mil@@ k, and it has never fallen out or lost its c@@ olo@@ ur@@ .
"@@ I have never used sham@@ po@@ o ei@@ ther@@ ," said M@@ ir@@ z@@ ay@@ ev@@ a.
Mon@@ th@@ ly pension is enough to live on
She has only ever e@@ aten what she could get from her own farm - tom@@ at@@ o@@ es, po@@ tat@@ o@@ es, pe@@ as.
My whole life I have never once bought gro@@ c@@ eri@@ es in the super@@ market.
Then she tells of her hus@@ band who was in the arm@@ y.
Th@@ ings were at their worst during the time after the Second World War.
However, everything became better when the "@@ bel@@ o@@ ved father@@ " H@@ ey@@ dar Ali@@ ye@@ v took the ru@@ d@@ der.
The propaganda seems strange coming from the mou@@ th of an old lad@@ y.
Yet the cul@@ t that revol@@ ved around the father figure for the nation, who governed his country like a dictator practically knows no limits in Azerbai@@ j@@ an.
He held power until 2003 and his son Il@@ ham later took over the hel@@ m.
At least there is no depriv@@ ation among Azerbai@@ j@@ an's elder@@ ly.
M@@ ir@@ z@@ ay@@ ev@@ a receives 2@@ 30 Man@@ at (@@ around the same sum in euro@@ s) per month as her pen@@ sion, which in a local context is an amount on which one can live comfort@@ ably.
And perhaps M@@ ir@@ z@@ ay@@ ev@@ a's long gre@@ ying son is righ@@ t: "@@ The elderly enjoy a deep respect in our cul@@ ture@@ ."
They live among their extended family, are lo@@ ved, car@@ ed for and are happ@@ y.
If this is not a reason to live for as long as possible, then what is@@ ?
The notion of "@@ human righ@@ ts@@ " is om@@ it@@ ted from the constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo@@ .
Comp@@ eting demonstrations in C@@ airo reveal the deep division within the country.
The future constitution based on Sharia law is fi@@ erc@@ ely dispu@@ ted.
The Egyptian President is not holding back his emo@@ tion.
We must make the transition.
"@@ And making sure it succe@@ eds is my responsibility, before the people and before Go@@ d@@ ," he said on state televi@@ sion.
His speech was aimed at the entire popul@@ ation@@ ,@@ however in particular at the C@@ op@@ tic Christi@@ ans, the liber@@ als, enlightened Muslims and secular@@ ists.
For all of them, until now hop@@ eless@@ ly est@@ ran@@ ged in a be@@ wil@@ dered opposition, are fear@@ ful.
They are fear@@ ful of a God State on the N@@ ile at the mer@@ cy of the powerful Muslim Brotherho@@ od.
According to Mohamed Mur@@ si, speaking almost ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tic@@ ally, he has temporarily restricted the authority of the constitutional court and increased his own authority, "@@ in order to rescue the revolution@@ ."
However, Egyptians - and the world - are not entirely sure what the 6@@ 1-@@ year-old engine@@ er who holds a D@@ oc@@ tor@@ ate from the American University of Southern Californi@@ a, really wants to sav@@ e.
Should the judiciary be depriv@@ ed of power@@ ?
In actual fact, the 23@@ 4 ar@@ tic@@ les, which have been pushed through by the Islam@@ ic@@ -@@ dominated 1@@ 10-@@ person Constitu@@ ent Ass@@ emb@@ ly, are in some aspects cause for concern.
As was also the case under previous constitu@@ tions, under the draft ju@@ dic@@ at@@ ure is justified on the "@@ principles of Islamic law@@ ."
Yet what are "@@ principl@@ es@@ "@@ ?
This was and remains subject to interpretation and there is concern that the Islamists will make use of the wo@@ ol@@ ly form@@ ulation and the resulting room for legal man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ re in fa@@ v@@ our of a stric@@ ter interpretation of Sharia law.
This is at least suggested by one newly added ar@@ tic@@ le: in all issues affecting Sharia law, the Al Ash@@ ar University must be consul@@ ted, the country's most important Islamic institu@@ tion, which has great influence throughout the whole of Sunni Islam.
This can, but does not necessarily have to mean that the cl@@ erg@@ y will over@@ see legislation, which would result in the de facto incap@@ ac@@ itation of the judici@@ ary.
Much in the constitutional draft is open to interpretation
Also problemati@@ c@@ : civil military jurisdic@@ tion will continue to be up@@ hel@@ d.
During Mubarak@@ 's rule, these courts served to suppress opposition.
Following the fall of the dictator@@ , up to 11@@ ,000 civilians were under military imprison@@ ment.
According to the dra@@ ft, the state should also protect "the true character of the Egyptian family, and promote its mor@@ als and valu@@ es@@ ."
From a legal perspective, this is formul@@ ated in such an un@@ clear manner that state institutions could even use this article to control the content of c@@ inem@@ atic art and literat@@ ure.
In pla@@ in language, this is nothing other than censor@@ ship.
In@@ cid@@ ent@@ ally, no article explicitly establish@@ es the equality of men and women.
Another does prohi@@ bit the insul@@ t or s@@ lan@@ der of the proph@@ et Mohamed and his emis@@ s@@ aries.
However, what constitutes an insul@@ t and how this should be sanc@@ tioned remains un@@ clear.
Equally dubious is the form@@ ulation stat@@ ing that "@@ insul@@ ting people@@ " is for@@ bid@@ den.
Is a car@@ ic@@ at@@ ure of the president suffici@@ ent, or a j@@ oke at the expense of a juri@@ st@@ ?
Open to interpret@@ ation, like so much in the draft sub@@ mitted by Mursi to be signed and that, in his own words, will be sub@@ mitted to Egyptians for referendum "@@ very so@@ on@@ ."
"@@ The revolution is back@@ "
For weeks the opposition has been gathering to combat the superior strength of the Islam@@ ists.
T@@ ens of thousands gathered on Fri@@ day ev@@ ening at the Tahri@@ r Square in Cairo@@ , in un@@ familiar unity, and pledged to bring down the char@@ ter before it has even come into effect.
"@@ The revolution is back and we are going to be vic@@ tori@@ ous@@ ," said Ham@@ din S@@ ab@@ bah@@ i, third place candidate in the presidential elections.
Nob@@ le Peace Prize winner and former He@@ ad of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Auth@@ ority, Mohamed El@@ -@@ Bar@@ ade@@ i explained that the constitutional draft belong@@ s "@@ on the rub@@ bis@@ h tip of histor@@ y@@ ."
Vi@@ a S@@ M@@ S service Twit@@ ter, he accused Mur@@ si@@ 's followers of wan@@ ting to lead "@@ a coup against democracy@@ ."
"@@ If he calls for the referendum, we will go to his pal@@ ace and overthrow him@@ ," said member of the opposition J@@ asser S@@ aid.
"@@ We have not yet grown ti@@ red, the blood of our bro@@ thers has not yet been at@@ oned for@@ ," stated the Egyptian media, quo@@ ting opposition politician C@@ hal@@ ed Ali@@ .
And several judges have sign@@ alled that they do not want to over@@ see the referendum, which would render it inv@@ ali@@ d.
"@@ The Kor@@ an is our constitu@@ tion@@ "
The well-@@ organis@@ ed Muslim Brotherhood gathered for a counter-@@ demonstra@@ tion, although acting cau@@ ti@@ ously they did not choose the Tahri@@ r Square but rather a mass pra@@ y@@ er on the other side of the Ni@@ le, outside the C@@ airo Universi@@ ty.
Many v@@ ei@@ led women and followers of the Salaf@@ is took part, sh@@ ou@@ ting out@@ : "@@ The people demand the application of Go@@ d@@ 's law@@ ."
They demanded of Mur@@ si@@ : "@@ C@@ lean@@ se the country@@ !@@ " and protes@@ te@@ d: "@@ The Kor@@ an is our constitu@@ tion@@ ."
A struggle for control over the symbolic Tahri@@ r S@@ quar@@ e, where everything began@@ , would have most likely provoked events ver@@ ging on civil war.
Qu@@ ite cle@@ arly, this was something that Mur@@ si@@ 's followers did not want to risk.
The Muslim Brothers stated that both those against and those in fa@@ v@@ our of the constitutional draft had expressed themselves lo@@ ud and clear.
Now is the time to let the population decide at the ballot box@@ , in which direction the country should move forward.
It is a certainty that there is a majority in fa@@ v@@ our of the Islam@@ ist@@ s' dra@@ ft.
"@@ The term '@@ human righ@@ ts@@ ' does not even appear on@@ c@@ e"
Haf@@ ez Abu Sa@@ ed@@ a is fu@@ ri@@ ous about this forced constitu@@ tive process, which actually should have lasted until February and should have involved all social interest groups.
The 4@@ 8-@@ year-old human rights lawy@@ er and Chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (E@@ O@@ H@@ R) defended the Muslim Brotherho@@ od, when imprison@@ ed or in court under Mubarak@@ .
Not because he shared their world view, but because for him, human rights are indi@@ visi@@ ble.
For this he was bat@@ ter@@ ed, condemned and imprison@@ ed.
"@@ And now the term human rights does not even appear once in the new constitu@@ tion@@ ," he be@@ mo@@ an@@ ed in a discussion with "@@ Welt am Sonn@@ tag@@ ."
The lawy@@ er has resigned himself to Mursi extending his power to all three bran@@ ches of state government.
These measures are b@@ lat@@ ant bre@@ ach@@ es of the ground rules of democracy and will guide Egypt into a new dictator@@ ship.
"@@ Instead of strengthening the civil society, the President is effectively sus@@ pending it@@ ," complained Sa@@ ed@@ a.
Yet without civil society organis@@ ations, a democracy cannot func@@ tion.
Sa@@ ed@@ a feels aband@@ on@@ ed@@ ,@@ even by the international community, which is obser@@ ving the battle over the ideological direction on the N@@ ile with a mix@@ ture of curi@@ osi@@ ty and exc@@ it@@ ement.
This could come back to ha@@ unt them.
One demonstrat@@ or at the Tahri@@ r war@@ ne@@ d: "@@ You are letting loose a mon@@ ster that you can no longer control@@ ."
Nor@@ wa@@ y's ra@@ k@@ fisk@@ : Is this the world's sm@@ elli@@ est fis@@ h@@ ?

Could the secret of the country's success be connected to the local appetite for some exce@@ ed@@ ingly sm@@ el@@ ly fis@@ h@@ ?
T@@ ake a selection of over-@@ ri@@ pe che@@ es@@ es.
Pl@@ ace them in the midst of a p@@ ile of dir@@ ty, we@@ t soccer k@@ it.
Lea@@ ve for a week@@ .
Now you have the no@@ se-@@ num@@ bing sm@@ ell of ra@@ k@@ fis@@ k, one of the great Norwe@@ gian delic@@ aci@@ es.
I am in the small town of F@@ ag@@ ern@@ es, about three hours from Os@@ lo@@ .
There is s@@ now, spectacular scen@@ ery - and that o@@ do@@ ur, ever pres@@ ent, hangs in the air@@ .
Rak@@ fis@@ k is tro@@ ut sprin@@ kl@@ ed with sal@@ t and fer@@ ment@@ ed in water for - depending on how sm@@ el@@ ly you like your fish - up to a year.
As the dark sets in and the weather turns col@@ d, Norwe@@ gi@@ ans flo@@ ck to a fes@@ tiv@@ al here in F@@ ag@@ ern@@ es devoted to this most, well, cap@@ tiv@@ ating of fo@@ od@@ s.
"@@ You eat it ra@@ w, and then s@@ wal@@ low a gl@@ ass of a@@ qu@@ av@@ it@@ ," says Hav@@ ard Hal@@ var@@ sen, full-@@ time local fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ter but also the so-called "@@ Rak@@ fis@@ k General@@ ," in charge of running the fes@@ tiv@@ al.
All around us people are e@@ ating little c@@ ub@@ es of the fish and kno@@ cking back quanti@@ ties of drin@@ k.
"@@ Some people like the a@@ qu@@ av@@ it more than the ra@@ k@@ fisk@@ ," says Hav@@ ar@@ d.
The drin@@ k can kill the sm@@ ell.
I try a few piec@@ es.
If you can avoid passing it under your no@@ se, it is not bad - not unlike a sli@@ ce of sus@@ hi that has been on rather a long bus jour@@ ne@@ y.
Rak@@ fis@@ k is a product of very different, pover@@ ty-@@ stri@@ cken times in Nor@@ way when, pre-@@ re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation, fish was so@@ aked in air@@ tight barrel@@ s of water and sal@@ t in autum@@ n.
Then in the dep@@ ths of w@@ inter@@ , well and truly fer@@ ment@@ ed, it is taken out and - no doubt with the sen@@ ses kno@@ cked out by alco@@ hol - e@@ aten.
Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwe@@ gi@@ ans were forced to leave their country in search of work, emig@@ rating mainly to the US.
Now the population is expanding fast - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by pl@@ enti@@ ful jobs, high wages and a comprehensive care system.
People from Sweden, the old rival and not so long ago far richer than Norway, stream in to work.
Rak@@ fis@@ k is seen as signi@@ fying something important, a vital if rather sm@@ el@@ ly part of Nor@@ wa@@ y's past.
It is among the more expensive dish@@ es you can bu@@ y.
But then everything is expensive - a small gl@@ ass of be@@ er or a sand@@ wi@@ ch kno@@ ck you back £@@ 9 ($@@ 14@@ ) e@@ ach@@ .
Nor@@ way does not often make it on to the global news agenda - and most seem to like it that way.
People here are still lo@@ ath to mention by name Anders B@@ rei@@ vi@@ k, the righ@@ t-@@ w@@ ing, rac@@ ist extremist who gun@@ ned down and killed 7@@ 7 men, women and children last year.
Instead, the sho@@ ot@@ ings are referred to as "the July the 2@@ 2@@ nd inci@@ dent@@ ."
Norwe@@ gi@@ ans find it very difficult to believe that in their peac@@ e-@@ lo@@ ving country one of their own was capable of such brut@@ ality and mur@@ der.
The growth since the early 1970@@ s of one of the world's biggest oil and gas industries lies behind much of Nor@@ wa@@ y's pres@@ ent-@@ day wealth.
"@@ But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well@@ ," says Ann@@ a our wa@@ it@@ res@@ s, hand@@ ing round tra@@ ys of mat@@ uring ra@@ k@@ fis@@ k and, with her long b@@ lon@@ d ha@@ ir and star@@ tl@@ ingly blu@@ e ey@@ es, the image of Nor@@ dic well-@@ being.
We are a - how you say - prudent people.
Her Engli@@ sh, like that of most people here, is flaw@@ less.
We are not very show@@ y, we do not like ost@@ ent@@ ation.
Nor@@ way has handled its oil wealth very carefully - all but a small percentage of money from the industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When everyone else was throwing around money they did not have, in the years leading up to the global financial cra@@ sh, Nor@@ way kept its pur@@ se str@@ ings tigh@@ tly bound@@ .
"@@ As long as we can ski in win@@ ter and go hi@@ king in summer we are happ@@ y@@ ," says Ann@@ a.
"@@ And eat ra@@ k@@ fisk@@ ," she adds with a car@@ ef@@ re@@ e laugh@@ .
I stand in the s@@ now and qu@@ eu@@ e for something to eat - I have had enough ra@@ k@@ fis@@ k.
Now an el@@ k bur@@ ger is certainly something different and rather succ@@ ul@@ ent to the ta@@ ste.
But in the even@@ ing, it is more of that sm@@ el@@ ly fis@@ h.
The ho@@ tel I am sta@@ ying in is one of a number of ven@@ u@@ es ho@@ sting a ra@@ k@@ fis@@ k d@@ inner where gu@@ ests vote on the best - or perhaps the most nas@@ ally challenging - fis@@ h.
There is a live TV link up to a comp@@ ere in a bo@@ w tie surrounded by pl@@ ates of ra@@ k@@ fis@@ k.
It is like the Euro@@ vision son@@ g con@@ tes@@ t.
"@@ What score do you have for the best fish up there in the moun@@ tains Th@@ or-@@ Ju@@ er@@ gen@@ ?"
"@@ Here are our poin@@ ts, Hav@@ ard@@ ."
There is cl@@ app@@ ing, laugh@@ ter.
A man falls off his chair@@ , perhaps overcome with a@@ qu@@ av@@ it.
Or maybe it is the f@@ um@@ es from all that fis@@ h.
Mexico@@ 's En@@ ri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to faces tough start
As Mexico@@ 's in@@ coming President En@@ ri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to prepar@@ es to take office, the BB@@ C@@ 's Will G@@ rant looks at the challenges facing him and the mixed expectations of his population.
Tra@@ ff@@ ic in Mexico City is particularly bad at pres@@ ent.
A con@@ gest@@ ed city at the best of times, a ring of steel has been er@@ ec@@ ted since Mon@@ day cutting off several key ro@@ utes into the capital and causing chaos on the road@@ s.
The aim@@ , however, was@@ n't to stop com@@ mu@@ ters getting to work but prevent protesters from reaching parliament@@ .
On Sat@@ ur@@ day, Mexico@@ 's new president En@@ ri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to will receive the presidential s@@ ash and take over the running of the nation.
He faces a complicated tas@@ k.
Mexico has been performing well economically under the out@@ going administration of F@@ eli@@ pe Calder@@ on, but the country is in the grip of a drug war, which has already claimed an estimated 60@@ ,000 lives in six years.
"@@ My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce the viol@@ enc@@ e@@ ," M@@ r Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to told US President Barack Obama in the O@@ val Office earlier this week@@ .
I will be proposing a new security strategy which will allow us to achieve that aim@@ .
Before rub@@ bing shoul@@ ders with the US president, M@@ r Pen@@ a Ni@@ et@@ o@@ 's previous political experience was as governor of his home state, the State of Mexico@@ .
A popul@@ ous, spra@@ w@@ ling state surrounding the capital, opini@@ ons about the new leader are divided in his old stom@@ ping ground.
A straight@@ forward man
In the bu@@ co@@ lic town of V@@ alle del Bra@@ vo@@ , for example, he is remembered fond@@ ly.
Res@@ id@@ ents credit him with boosting tou@@ rism in the resort and building infrastructure.
To reach the town you can drive along one of M@@ r Pen@@ a Ni@@ et@@ o@@ 's new mo@@ tor@@ ways, a vast improvement on the cra@@ cked and b@@ ump@@ y roads it replac@@ ed.

"@@ We are looking to him to bring about real and lasting change@@ ," says friend and political ally G@@ abri@@ el Ol@@ ver@@ a H@@ ern@@ an@@ de@@ z, a state congres@@ s@@ man for M@@ r Pen@@ a Ni@@ et@@ o@@ 's party, the PRI@@ .
Par@@ ticul@@ arly in terms of security and the economy, we@@ '@@ re hoping for an interesting and true change which our country so badly needs.
After an un@@ broken 8@@ 1 years in power, the PR@@ I was ou@@ sted in 2000 by Vic@@ ente F@@ ox@@ .
Congres@@ s@@ man Ol@@ ver@@ a ad@@ mits that after 12 years outside the presidential pal@@ ace of Los Pino@@ s, there is much expectation within the party about En@@ ri@@ que Pen@@ a Ni@@ et@@ o.
And he rejec@@ ts the opposition@@ 's character@@ is@@ ation of the new president as lacking subst@@ ance.
He@@ 's a very straight@@ forward man, very committed with an excellent vision of the country.
He@@ 's an excellent states@@ man and, above all, he@@ 's someone who knows how to li@@ sten.
But on the other side of the state, that is not the impression many people have of their former govern@@ or.
In Ne@@ z@@ ah@@ ual@@ co@@ yo@@ tl@@ , also known as Ci@@ u@@ dad Ne@@ z@@ a, the contrast with the co@@ b@@ bled streets of V@@ alle del Bra@@ vo co@@ uld@@ n't be shar@@ per@@ .
Tu@@ cked away under mo@@ tor@@ way fl@@ y@@ over@@ s, it is in many ways a sub@@ ur@@ b of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municip@@ ality are also g@@ rit@@ ty and ur@@ b@@ an.
Ear@@ lier this year, the military was called in to help tackle the drug gangs operating in the neigh@@ bour@@ ho@@ ods, and violence against women is particularly acu@@ te.
On a pat@@ ch of wa@@ stel@@ and by a vast land@@ fill si@@ te, the bodies of dozens of mur@@ dered women have been dump@@ ed over the past two years alone.
More than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico State while M@@ r Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to was govern@@ or, a rate much higher than in the notori@@ ously violent city of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z - a place sy@@ non@@ y@@ mous with the murder of innocent women.
M@@ r Pen@@ a Ni@@ et@@ o@@ 's critics say, at best, he failed to adequately address the problem of fem@@ ici@@ de while he was in office.

According to the official version of events, Mari@@ ana committed suicide in 2010.

Bra@@ d@@ ley Mann@@ ing did@@ n't complain about mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment, prosecut@@ ors con@@ tend
Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors try to counter Bra@@ d@@ ley Mann@@ ing@@ 's claims of abuse in confin@@ ement
The hearing focuses on Mann@@ ing@@ 's time in the military bri@@ g at Qu@@ anti@@ co, Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a
Defense wants case dismissed on grounds that Mann@@ ing@@ 's confin@@ ement was harsh
The Army private is accused of ste@@ aling thousands of classi@@ fied documents
Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors tried to establish Fri@@ day that Army private Bra@@ d@@ ley Mann@@ ing -- charged in the largest lea@@ k of classi@@ fied material in U@@ .@@ S. history -- missed multiple opportunities to complain about the mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment he@@ 's alleg@@ ing he suffered in military cu@@ sto@@ d@@ y.
While cross-@@ exam@@ ining Mann@@ ing at a pre-@@ trial hearing at F@@ t. Me@@ a@@ de, Mar@@ y@@ land, prosecut@@ or Maj@@ . Ash@@ den F@@ ein asser@@ ted that records of week@@ ly visi@@ ts Mann@@ ing had with unit officers during nine months of deten@@ tion at Qu@@ anti@@ co, Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a, show no complaints about his treatment.
The cross-@@ exam@@ ination -- during a hearing on a defense motion to have Mann@@ ing@@ 's case dismissed on grounds that his confin@@ ement has been harsh and has amounted to enough punishment -- came a day after Mann@@ ing t@@ esti@@ fied that he had considered suicide while in cu@@ sto@@ d@@ y.
The Army intelligence analy@@ st, arrested in June 2010, is accused of ste@@ aling thousands of classi@@ fied documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online by WikiLe@@ ak@@ s.
WikiLe@@ aks has never confirmed that Mann@@ ing was the source of its information.
In Fri@@ da@@ y's hear@@ ing, F@@ ein re@@ viewed with Mann@@ ing the forms that officers filled out after meeting with Mann@@ ing during his deten@@ tion at Qu@@ anti@@ co@@ 's bri@@ g, where he was held under a heightened confin@@ ement status from July 2010 to April 2011.
Off@@ ic@@ ers would ask Mann@@ ing questions and write down his respon@@ ses.
When F@@ ein asked about the forms Fri@@ day, Mann@@ ing acknowledged that he rated treatment by his guar@@ ds as "@@ excell@@ ent@@ " and treatment by the facility overall as "@@ very profession@@ al@@ ."
The forms show no complaints of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment, even though the officers asked Mann@@ ing directly about his treatment, F@@ ein conten@@ ded.
Mann@@ ing responded that he would verb@@ ally express concern about issues and that the visi@@ ting officers would talk through the concerns and indicate that they would be addres@@ sed, but they did@@ n't record the issues.
"@@ They would write down '@@ no issu@@ es' (@@ after discussing the concern@@ s), and it did@@ n't necessarily mean I did@@ n't bring something up@@ ," Mann@@ ing sa@@ id.
The jud@@ ge, Army Col@@ . Den@@ ise Lin@@ d, also asked Mann@@ ing why he did@@ n't complain about his treatment during a January 2011 meeting with a board exam@@ ining the suici@@ d@@ al though@@ ts he expressed in a form months ear@@ lier@@ .
Mann@@ ing rep@@ lied that his intention during that meeting was to get his "@@ prevention of inj@@ ur@@ y" status down@@ gra@@ ded.
The military said they put him on this restric@@ tive status -- a step below suicide watch -- for his protection and the safety of others.
"@@ I wanted staff to know I was fin@@ e, and (@@ I wanted to@@ ) get off the P@@ O@@ I status ... to enjoy an increased quality of life from my view@@ poin@@ t@@ ," Mann@@ ing sa@@ id.
Mann@@ ing t@@ esti@@ fied Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwa@@ it, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the bri@@ g at Marine B@@ ase Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a in July 2010.
He said he contempl@@ ated suicide in Kuwait and once passed out there due to the he@@ at.
He said not being allowed to know what was happening to him or in the outside world was distres@@ s@@ ing.
"@@ My world just shrink to Cam@@ p Ara@@ f@@ j@@ on, to that c@@ age@@ ," Mann@@ ing said Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day.
I thought I was going to die in that c@@ age.
Once at Qu@@ anti@@ co, Mann@@ ing said, he spend most days in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours -- with no compan@@ y.
Mann@@ ing said he was allowed only a mat@@ t@@ res@@ s, bl@@ ank@@ et, fli@@ p@@ -@@ flo@@ p@@ s, some clo@@ th@@ es and his g@@ lass@@ es.
He said he tried to keep mo@@ ving, because sle@@ eping during the day or even lying down was against the rules.
Mann@@ ing said he always sle@@ pt with light from outside his cell in his ey@@ es.
If guar@@ ds could not see his face when he roll@@ ed over at nigh@@ t, he said they would wake him to roll back over.
Mann@@ ing@@ 's lawy@@ er fil@@ ed a formal objec@@ tion to Mann@@ ing@@ 's treatment in January 2011.
Mann@@ ing was moved to the military prison at For@@ t Lea@@ ven@@ wor@@ th, Kan@@ s@@ as, in April 2011.
Also Fri@@ day, the judge asked Mann@@ ing about an alleg@@ ation that he made in Th@@ ur@@ s@@ da@@ y's testim@@ ony -- that after being forced to sle@@ ep n@@ aked one night in his Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o c@@ ell, he was forced to stand n@@ aked in front of guar@@ ds and other in@@ m@@ ates during a mor@@ ning head coun@@ t.
Mann@@ ing had t@@ esti@@ fied that he was never given a chance to cover himself with his bl@@ ank@@ et during the head coun@@ t.
Under ques@@ tioning from the judge Fri@@ day, Mann@@ ing said that he in@@ fer@@ red from his guar@@ d@@ 's order that he should drop a bl@@ ank@@ et that could have covered him, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Mann@@ ing t@@ esti@@ fied Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day that he was forced to sle@@ ep n@@ aked the previous night because of his attempt to show an offic@@ er that he was@@ n't a danger to himself@@ .
Mann@@ ing said that he told the offic@@ er that he could have used the wa@@ ist@@ band of his under@@ we@@ ar or his fli@@ p@@ -@@ flo@@ ps to hurt himself but had@@ n't done so.
That nigh@@ t, Mann@@ ing t@@ esti@@ fied, his under@@ we@@ ar, fli@@ p@@ -@@ flo@@ ps and g@@ lass@@ es were removed from his cell@@ .
His lawyers hope the judge will at least take his experiences during confin@@ ement into account and sharply reduce his sent@@ ence should he be convic@@ ted at his cour@@ t-@@ mar@@ ti@@ al, which is expected to begin early next year.
The defense has said it plans to have Mann@@ ing p@@ lead guilty to lesser off@@ enses and fight other charges as being too extre@@ me.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this week@@ end, with prosecut@@ ors expected to argue that the deten@@ tion conditions were warran@@ ted.
The Pentagon has maintained that Mann@@ ing was held in accord@@ ance with rules governing all maxim@@ um-@@ cu@@ sto@@ dy detain@@ ees at Qu@@ anti@@ co@@ .
Coun@@ ts against Mann@@ ing include ai@@ ding the enem@@ y, wrong@@ fully causing intelligence to be published on the Internet, trans@@ mitting national defense information and th@@ eft of public property or record@@ s.
If he@@ 's convic@@ ted on all coun@@ ts, he could face a life sent@@ ence.
My Mex@@ ic@@ an-@@ American identity crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities there
Mex@@ ic@@ ans tend to fault those who le@@ ft@@ ; they remind Mex@@ ic@@ ans of hard times, he says
Nav@@ ar@@ ret@@ te says Mex@@ ic@@ an-@@ Americans are caught between two worl@@ ds
On a recent trip to Mexico C@@ ity, I had barely made my way down the con@@ course and arrived at the immigration processing area when I got st@@ ump@@ ed.
Sig@@ ns pointed the way to two lin@@ es: one for "@@ Mex@@ ic@@ ano@@ s" (@@ "@@ Mex@@ ic@@ ans@@ "@@ ), another for "@@ Ex@@ tran@@ j@@ ero@@ s" (@@ "@@ For@@ eig@@ ner@@ s@@ .@@ "@@ )
I stood there for a few second@@ s, un@@ sure of where to go.
Gro@@ wing up in Central Californi@@ a, I had been called a "@@ Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ " my entire life.
It@@ 's ethnic shor@@ th@@ and in the same way that my friends in Boston ref@@ er to themselves as "@@ I@@ ri@@ sh@@ " or my friends in New York describe themselves as "@@ Itali@@ an@@ ."
Lat@@ er, I settled on "@@ Mex@@ ic@@ an-@@ Americ@@ an@@ ."
But, this was Mexico@@ .
And, in the hom@@ eland of my grand@@ father, there was no need for shor@@ th@@ and or hy@@ ph@@ ens.
I was simply an Americ@@ an.
I speak Sp@@ an@@ ish@@ , good enough to handle either end of an inter@@ view in that langu@@ age.
But I don't have the voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary of a n@@ ative, and I can@@ 't sh@@ ake my American ac@@ cent@@ .
So I took my U@@ .@@ S. pas@@ sport and got in the line for Ex@@ tran@@ j@@ ero@@ s.
I thought about that moment this week when Mexican presid@@ ent-@@ elect En@@ ri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda, as usu@@ al, when the leaders of these two countries meet@@ : immigration, drugs and trade.
Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason that Mex@@ ic@@ ans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico as venture to the United States.
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada, and create a European Uni@@ on-@@ style trading bloc in North America.
And Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to vo@@ wed to continue Mexico@@ 's war against the drug car@@ tel@@ s, even though he offered no specific@@ s.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with hard feel@@ ings.
Most Americans probably never give a thought to the fact that, in 18@@ 4@@ 8, the United States inv@@ aded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half their territory at the point of ri@@ f@@ le.
But for Mex@@ ic@@ ans, who think in terms of centuries, not min@@ ut@@ es, the remin@@ ders are everywhere.
So the min@@ ute that a U@@ .@@ S. official says anything the least bit critical of Mexico, you start hearing -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how the Americans are enc@@ ro@@ ach@@ ing upon their neighbor@@ 's sovereignty.
And the children of Mon@@ te@@ zu@@ ma go on the war@@ path.
And yet, for Mexico, the really challenging relationship is with the more than 35 million Mex@@ ic@@ an-@@ Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hard feel@@ ing@@ s?
There is plent@@ y.
Mexico has winners and loser@@ s, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it does@@ n@@ '@@ t.
The only reason you have so many people of Mexican anc@@ est@@ ry living in cities like Los Angel@@ es, L@@ as V@@ eg@@ as, P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x@@ , Den@@ ver or San Ant@@ oni@@ o is because, at some point in our family tre@@ e, there was a person@@ , maybe a par@@ ent or grand@@ par@@ ent, who was shut out from opportunity in Mexico and had to go nor@@ th.
And more often than not, that person fit a profile -- dark sk@@ in, little education, from a poor vil@@ lage, et@@ c.
We@@ '@@ re their off@@ spr@@ ing, and we@@ '@@ re loyal to them.
Not Mexico@@ .
And even though we may now be living the American Dre@@ am, having gone to good schools and taken good jobs, we can never lose sight of the fact that it@@ 's the American Dre@@ am we@@ '@@ re liv@@ ing, and not the Mexican one.
Our identity might sometimes be fu@@ zz@@ y, but our loyalty is clear.
It@@ 's to the United States.
Bes@@ id@@ es, we@@ '@@ re aware that many of the elite Mex@@ ic@@ ans in the ruling class don't like us.
The feeling is mut@@ u@@ al.
They see us as a reminder of a humili@@ ating defeat and look down on us as inf@@ eri@@ or stock that is@@ n't sufficiently Mex@@ ic@@ an.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.
Our existence is, as they see it, all about failure.
If our families had@@ n't failed in Mexico, they wo@@ uld@@ n't have left.
And we wo@@ uld@@ n't now find ourselves trapped behind the sil@@ k cur@@ tain@@ , living well in the United States but lost soul@@ s noneth@@ el@@ ess.
My wi@@ fe, who was born in Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara and came to the United States legally as a chil@@ d, reminds me that there is fric@@ tion between Mex@@ ic@@ ans and Mex@@ ic@@ an-@@ Americans because Mex@@ ic@@ ans have a fir@@ mer grasp of who they are and Mex@@ ic@@ an-@@ Americans res@@ ent that.
While she@@ 's a U@@ .@@ S. citiz@@ en, she sees her@@ self as a part of two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mex@@ ic@@ an-@@ Americans I know don't feel like the@@ y@@ '@@ re a part of either.
We love list@@ ening to the Mexican b@@ and, Los Tig@@ res del Nor@@ te, but also to Bru@@ ce Sp@@ ring@@ ste@@ en.
You get the best of both world@@ s, but you@@ '@@ re rooted in nei@@ ther.
In Mexico, we@@ '@@ re seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we@@ '@@ re considered Mex@@ ic@@ an.
Now, to complic@@ ate the relationship even further, as I learned during my tri@@ p, some Mexican leaders and parts of the intelligent@@ sia want to re@@ connect with the Di@@ aspor@@ a.
They want to put Mex@@ ic@@ an-@@ Americans to work as mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft "@@ ambass@@ ad@@ or@@ s" for Mexico, representing its interest in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans what a great country this is to visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico@@ .
Y@@ e@@ ah.
That@@ 's not going to happen.
Too many hard feel@@ ings.
And, with income inequality and rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is a great country.
I@@ '@@ m afraid you@@ '@@ re on your own, am@@ ig@@ os.
That@@ 's fair@@ .
If at least some Mex@@ ic@@ ans aren@@ 't yet ready to for@@ give the United States for how it treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mex@@ ic@@ an-@@ Americans still hold a gru@@ dge for how their family members were treated much more recently than that.
H@@ mm@@ m.
May@@ be we@@ '@@ re more "@@ Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ " than I though@@ t.
Old batt@@ les, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could yet be an unlikely foundation for peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East@@ ?
Another round of blood@@ shed suggests that any such hope is v@@ ain@@ .
Am@@ id the usual fu@@ tile arguments over who started it, scores of buil@@ dings have been reduced to rub@@ ble@@ ; more than 1@@ 40 Palestinians, most of them civili@@ ans, and six Israelis have been kil@@ led@@ ; and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have lan@@ ded near T@@ el Avi@@ v, Israel@@ 's met@@ ro@@ poli@@ s, and the hol@@ y city of Jerusal@@ em@@ .
But though the Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their ancient conflict, all around them the Middle East is chang@@ ing.
The Arab spring has thrown the piec@@ es up in the air, and, like it or not, the Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in the regional turmo@@ il.
May@@ be this will make their struggle blo@@ odi@@ er than before.
However, there are reasons for thinking it could just break their lethal stalem@@ ate.
A war that is neither lost or won
At first sigh@@ t, optimism looks very hard to justify now.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 2@@ 1@@ st hol@@ ds, this week@@ 's fighting has strengthened the haw@@ ks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to back off, even though Gaza has taken a dru@@ b@@ b@@ ing.
Despite killing some of its leaders and bott@@ ling up Gaz@@ a's 1.@@ 7@@ m people in one of the most w@@ ret@@ ched and crow@@ ded cor@@ ners of the plan@@ et, Israel has failed to destroy Ham@@ as.
In@@ de@@ ed Hamas is gaining on the West Bank, the other bit of Palestine currently run by its bitter rivals in Fat@@ ah, the more moderate Palestinian fac@@ tion.
Moreover, Hamas@@ 's leaders may well conclude that time is on their side.
As Islamists across the Arab world have gained clou@@ t, so Hamas has made powerful and rich friend@@ s.
Turkey, a res@@ urgent regional power that was once Israel@@ 's closest Muslim ally, has taken up Hamas@@ 's cau@@ se; so has Qat@@ ar, one of the richest and most dynamic of the Gulf states.
J@@ ub@@ il@@ ant Hamas people say an Islamist c@@ res@@ cent is cur@@ ving around Israel, from Lebanon in the nor@@ th, where the H@@ iz@@ bul@@ lah part@@ y-@@ cum@@ -@@ militi@@ a holds s@@ way, through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist b@@ ent may topp@@ le Bashar Assad, and on down through Jordan, where Hamas@@ 's allies are men@@ ac@@ ing the k@@ ing.
Above all, on Israel@@ 's southern fl@@ ank@@ , the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most popul@@ ous and pivo@@ tal of Arab countries, has changed the region@@ 's balance.
Hosni Mubarak@@ , the secular despo@@ t who ran Egypt for 30 years until his down@@ fall in 2011, had little time for Ham@@ as.
By contrast, the Brotherhood is a cou@@ sin of Hamas, and its leaders are more subject to popular opini@@ on.
In future diplomacy Hamas may emerge as an actor that cannot be shut out even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, Israel@@ 's hard@@ lin@@ ers will draw the opposite conclu@@ sions.
In military terms, Hamas has been put back in its box@@ .
Israel@@ 's I@@ ron D@@ ome anti-@@ missile system has proved its worth and many of Hamas@@ 's missiles have been destro@@ y@@ ed.
Israelis will sle@@ ep more sound@@ ly - for a whi@@ le.
In diplomatic terms, America is as stead@@ fast as ever@@ ; many European countries also blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence.
Above all, Israel has prosper@@ ed, especially under Bin@@ y@@ amin Netany@@ ah@@ u, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rock@@ ets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been fairly free of suici@@ de-@@ bom@@ ber@@ s, thanks in part to the barri@@ er that bit@@ es into the West Bank, the main ch@@ unk of a woul@@ d-@@ be Palestinian state, and protec@@ ts the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illeg@@ ality in international law.
M@@ r Netany@@ ah@@ u, whose Liku@@ d party has mer@@ ged with an even more haw@@ k@@ ish lot under A@@ vig@@ d@@ or Lie@@ ber@@ man in the run-up to an election on January 2@@ 2@@ n@@ d, is sitting pre@@ tt@@ y.
Why co@@ dd@@ le those twi@@ st@@ y Palestinians by giving them a state of their ow@@ n?
If they really ran the West Bank, would they not fire rock@@ ets, just as their comp@@ at@@ riots have done in Gaz@@ a?
Better to keep them behind that wall and s@@ mit@@ e them if they raise their head@@ s.
May@@ be the hard@@ lin@@ ers will win out@@ ; yet the Arab spring may change their calcul@@ ations.
Even if the Islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere have little love for Israel, their priority will be tackling difficulties at home.
Israel@@ 's def@@ ence budget is bigger than that of its four Arab neigh@@ bo@@ urs combin@@ ed.
Star@@ ting a war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments men@@ d their economies.
That the pragmatic M@@ r Morsi worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ceasefire aug@@ urs well - and might just mark the start of someth@@ ing.
Israelis too should look to the longer term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depri@@ ving Palestinians of their right to self-@@ determination is creating a po@@ w@@ der ke@@ g that is bound one day to explo@@ de in the territories occupied by Israel - much as a bus explo@@ ded in T@@ el Avi@@ v this week@@ .
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and demograph@@ y exacerb@@ ates this as the Arab population s@@ well@@ s.
Blo@@ od@@ y missions against Gaza every few years to kno@@ ck back Hamas will exact a growing diplomatic t@@ oll@@ .
Both sides need pro@@ d@@ ding by outsi@@ ders
The answer remains the one trump@@ eted by sensible people on both sid@@ es, most of the outside world and this newspap@@ er: two states, with Israel c@@ eding territory for security.
The hope - a small one in the short term - is that the ceasefire will give a little more leverage to outsi@@ ders pushing that cause.
Egypt, which must now set about stopp@@ ing the flow of arms into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qat@@ ar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 boundaries with land sw@@ aps and a shared Jerusal@@ em@@ .
Arab outsi@@ ders should also press Hamas and Fatah to come together.
That would do more to create a Palestinian state than the imminent bid for virtual stateho@@ od at the UN@@ .
M@@ r Obama also has a part in getting Israel to the table.
During his first term, he neglected to present his own plan for peace.
Back in the White Hous@@ e, he is looking just as reluctant to be drawn in.
This is wo@@ efully short-@@ sigh@@ ted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
That means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
C@@ ig@@ ar@@ ette pla@@ in pack@@ aging laws come into force in Australia
S@@ mo@@ king warnings and diseas@@ ed body parts emb@@ la@@ zon@@ ed on dul@@ l green box@@ es that are the same for all tobacco br@@ ands
Australi@@ a's world-@@ first laws on ci@@ gar@@ ette and tobacco pla@@ in pack@@ aging have come into force, replacing brand lo@@ go@@ s and c@@ olo@@ urs with generi@@ c dra@@ b o@@ live green cover@@ ings, gru@@ es@@ ome pic@@ tures of diseas@@ ed body parts and dep@@ ic@@ tions of children and bab@@ ies made ill by their par@@ ents@@ ' smo@@ k@@ ing.
A@@ part from the var@@ ying health warnings and images the only difference between the pack@@ s, mandatory from Sat@@ ur@@ day, are the brand nam@@ es, and these are all prin@@ ted in iden@@ tical small f@@ on@@ t.
It is the world's most strict regime for the pack@@ aging of to@@ bac@@ co@@ .
Australi@@ a's federal government says the aim is to deter young people from smo@@ king by stri@@ pping the hab@@ it of g@@ lam@@ our@@ .
It is relying on studies showing that if people have not started smo@@ king by age 26 there is a 9@@ 9% chance they will never take it up.
"@@ Even from a very early age you can see that ki@@ ds understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their br@@ and@@ ing@@ ," said the federal health minister, T@@ anya P@@ liber@@ sek@@ , c@@ iting studies that show@@ ed, for example, children lin@@ king a c@@ rown in a lo@@ go with the idea of being a pr@@ inc@@ ess.
While Australia has one of the world's lowest smo@@ king rates and the changes will have little impact on multination@@ al@@ s' prof@@ its, other countries are considering similar step@@ s.
The tobacco industry lobbi@@ ed hard against the law@@ s.
Tob@@ acco firms said they would boost black market trade, leading to cheap@@ er, more accessible ci@@ gar@@ ett@@ es.
"@@ There will be serious unintended consequences from the legisl@@ ation@@ ," said Sco@@ tt Mc@@ In@@ ty@@ re of British American Tob@@ acco Australi@@ a.
Co@@ unter@@ fei@@ ters from China and Indonesia will bring lo@@ ts more of these products down to sell on the streets of Australi@@ a.
Others say the laws have boosted their business.
Sand@@ ra H@@ a of Z@@ ico Im@@ port P@@ ty L@@ t@@ d, a small family business, said demand for ci@@ gar@@ ette cases, si@@ lic@@ on cover@@ s to mas@@ k the un@@ pal@@ at@@ able pack@@ ages, had shot up from almost nothing two months ago since British American Tob@@ ac@@ co, Britain@@ 's Imperi@@ al Tob@@ ac@@ co, Phili@@ p Mor@@ ris and Japan Tob@@ acco lost a challenge to the laws in Australi@@ a's high cour@@ t.
H@@ a said Z@@ ico had sold up to 6@@ ,000 to whol@@ es@@ ale out@@ lets and was awa@@ iting new stock@@ .
This is good business for us.
The potential hit@@ ch, experts say, is the popularity of social media with the very demographic the plan is tar@@ get@@ ing.
After a series of Australian laws bann@@ ing TV adverti@@ sing and sports sponsor@@ ship and requiring most sell@@ ers to hide ci@@ gar@@ ett@@ es from view, tobacco market@@ ing has moved on@@ line.
Australia has banned we@@ b adverti@@ sing by local companies and sites but cannot restrict overseas si@@ tes.
"@@ If you are a tobacco market@@ er and you@@ '@@ ve only got this small window left to promote your products, online is the compelling place for you to be in@@ ," said B@@ eck@@ y Fre@@ em@@ an, a public health resear@@ cher at Sy@@ d@@ ney Universi@@ ty.
Fre@@ em@@ an noted an increase in "@@ average Jo@@ e" re@@ views of br@@ ands on social media sites such as You@@ Tu@@ be, Twitter and Facebo@@ ok@@ .
We have to as@@ k, is that just a private citizen who really lo@@ ves Mar@@ l@@ bor@@ o ci@@ gar@@ ett@@ es and the@@ y@@ '@@ ve gone to the trouble of making a vide@@ o, or is there a market@@ ing company invol@@ v@@ ed?
British American Tob@@ acco Australia said the industry was focused on dealing with the new rules rather than market@@ ing.
The industry has gone as far as paying for Ukraine, Hon@@ dura@@ s and the Domini@@ can Republic to challenge the new rules - the countries are claiming at the World Trade Organisation that trade is being unfair@@ ly restric@@ ted, despite none of the countries having significant trade with Australi@@ a.
A WTO ruling is likely in mid-@@ 2013.
P@@ liber@@ se@@ k said the government had held discussions with other countries considering similar laws on pack@@ ag@@ ing.
Canada was the first country to make photo@@ gra@@ ph warnings mandatory in 2001.
They now extend to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
T@@ ough@@ er laws are being considered in Britain, New Zeal@@ and, South Africa and India.
Many smo@@ kers in Australia remain defi@@ ant.
The pic@@ tures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.

In a Con@@ st@@ antly Plu@@ g@@ ge@@ d-@@ In Worl@@ d, It@@ 's Not All Bad to B@@ e Bor@@ ed
I spent five unexpected hours in an air@@ port this Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving holi@@ day when our plane had mechan@@ ical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane to arri@@ ve.
So I had plenty of time to think about the subject of bor@@ ed@@ om@@ .
I won@@ 't lie to you@@ .
Hal@@ f a day in an air@@ port waiting for a flight is pretty te@@ di@@ ous, even with the distrac@@ tions of book@@ s, maga@@ zin@@ es and i@@ Ph@@ ones (@@ not to mention d@@ ut@@ y-@@ free sh@@ opp@@ ing@@ ).
But increas@@ ingly, some academ@@ ics and child development experts are coming out in pra@@ ise of bor@@ ed@@ om@@ .
It@@ 's all right for us - and our children - to be bor@@ ed on occa@@ sion, they sa@@ y.
It forces the brain to go on interesting tang@@ ents, perhaps fostering creativ@@ ity.
And because most of us are almost consistently plu@@ gged into one scre@@ en or another these days, we don't experience the benefits of bor@@ ed@@ om@@ .
So should we embrace bor@@ ed@@ om@@ ?
Y@@ es.
And no@@ .
But I@@ '@@ ll get back to that.
First of all, like many people, I assumed that bor@@ ed@@ om was a relatively recent phenomen@@ on, with the adv@@ ent of more lei@@ sure time.
Not so, says Peter To@@ o@@ he@@ y, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Cal@@ g@@ ary in Canada and the author of "@@ Bor@@ ed@@ om@@ : A Liv@@ ely Histor@@ y" (@@ Yale University Pres@@ s, 201@@ 1@@ ).
"@@ Bor@@ ed@@ om actually has a very long histor@@ y@@ ," he sa@@ id.
Ther@@ e's Latin gra@@ ff@@ iti about bor@@ ed@@ om on the walls of P@@ om@@ p@@ ei@@ i d@@ ating from the first century.
Then there@@ 's the question of how we define bor@@ ed@@ om@@ .
The trouble is that it has been defin@@ ed, and disc@@ uss@@ ed, in many different ways, said John D. East@@ wo@@ od, an associ@@ ate professor of psych@@ ology at York University in On@@ tari@@ o, Can@@ ada.
After looking over the research literat@@ ure and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor East@@ wo@@ od and his colleagues defined bor@@ ed@@ om as an experience of "@@ wan@@ ting to, but being unable to engage in satis@@ fying activ@@ it@@ y@@ ."
What separ@@ ates bor@@ ed@@ om from ap@@ ath@@ y, he said, is that the person is not engaged but wants to be.
With ap@@ ath@@ y, he said, there is no urge to do someth@@ ing.
The core experience of bor@@ ed@@ om@@ , he said, is "@@ disruption of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a sense that time is passing slow@@ ly@@ ."
Bor@@ ed@@ om can sound an aw@@ ful lot like depression.
But Professor East@@ wo@@ od said that while they can be rel@@ ated, people who are bor@@ ed tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem as themselves.
Sometimes we think we@@ '@@ re bor@@ ed when we just have difficulty concent@@ rat@@ ing.
In their stud@@ y, "@@ The Un@@ engaged Min@@ d: Def@@ ining Bor@@ ed@@ om in Ter@@ ms of At@@ ten@@ tion@@ ," which appeared in the journ@@ al Per@@ spec@@ tives on Psych@@ ological Science in September, Professor East@@ wo@@ od and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants list@@ ened to a tap@@ e of a person reading a maga@@ z@@ ine ar@@ tic@@ le.
Some groups heard a lo@@ ud and un@@ related television program in the next room@@ , others heard it at a low level so it was barely notic@@ e@@ able, while the third group did@@ n't hear the sound@@ track at all.
The ones who heard the low-@@ level TV reported more bor@@ ed@@ om than the other two groups - they had difficulty concent@@ rating but were not sure why, and attributed that difficulty to bor@@ ed@@ om@@ .
When you@@ '@@ re trying to focus on a difficult or engaging tas@@ k, disruption of attention can lead to bor@@ ed@@ om@@ , said Mark J. F@@ en@@ sk@@ e, an associ@@ ate professor of neuro@@ science at the University of Gu@@ el@@ ph in On@@ tari@@ o and one of the auth@@ ors of the stud@@ y.
On the other hand, when you@@ '@@ re doing something dul@@ l, "@@ such as looking for bad wid@@ gets on a factory line, distrac@@ ting musi@@ c can help you not be bor@@ ed@@ ."
In fact, he said, we now know that squ@@ ir@@ ming and do@@ od@@ ling, often seen as a sign of bor@@ ed@@ om@@ , can actually help combat it by keeping people more physi@@ cally al@@ ert.
"@@ Research shows that ki@@ ds who are allowed to fi@@ d@@ get learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still@@ ," Professor F@@ en@@ sk@@ e sa@@ id.
We all experience bor@@ ed@@ om at some points - my flight dela@@ y, a d@@ ron@@ ing speak@@ er, a particularly te@@ di@@ ous movi@@ e.
But some individuals are more likely to be bor@@ ed than others.
To help measure this, researchers developed a "@@ Bor@@ ed@@ om P@@ ron@@ eness S@@ cal@@ e" in the 1980@@ s.
The scale includes questions lik@@ e, "@@ Many things I have to do are repe@@ ti@@ tive and mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ous@@ ," and "@@ I have so many interests, I don't have time to do every@@ th@@ ing@@ ."
Using such scal@@ es, researchers have discovered that boys tend to be bor@@ ed more often than girl@@ s, said Ste@@ phen V@@ od@@ ano@@ vi@@ ch, a professor of psych@@ ology at the University of West Flori@@ da, especially when it comes need@@ ing more, and a variety of, external stimul@@ ation.
But in general, te@@ enag@@ ers are a pretty j@@ aded lo@@ t.
In 1991, Re@@ ed Lar@@ son, a professor of human and community development at the University of I@@ ll@@ ino@@ is, conducted an experiment in which he contac@@ ted almost 400 te@@ enag@@ ers and their parents seven to eight times a day by be@@ e@@ per@@ .
He found that 32 perc@@ ent of ad@@ ol@@ es@@ cents said they were bor@@ ed in school and doing home@@ work, while 23 perc@@ ent said they were bor@@ ed when they wer@@ en@@ 't in school@@ .
On the other hand, 3 perc@@ ent of parents said they were bor@@ ed.
Professor Lar@@ son said he did not know whether the bor@@ ed@@ om percent@@ ages now, 21 years later, would be higher or lower@@ .
But he said he did know that "@@ ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ence is a peak period for bor@@ ed@@ om@@ ," largely because children and te@@ enag@@ ers are not given a lot of control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: Is bor@@ ed@@ om good for you@@ ?
Sometimes no@@ , because in its extreme it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, gam@@ ble or in@@ dul@@ ge in subst@@ ance abuse as a way to ease it, research show@@ s.
On the other hand, many philosop@@ her@@ s and wri@@ ters discuss the connection between bor@@ ed@@ om and creativ@@ ity, said Professor V@@ od@@ ano@@ vi@@ ch, who has been stud@@ ying the issue for more than two decades.
"@@ Bor@@ ed@@ om is the bra@@ in@@ 's way to tell you you should be doing something else@@ ," said G@@ ary Mar@@ c@@ us, a professor of psych@@ ology at N@@ .@@ Y@@ .@@ U@@ .
But the brain does@@ n't always know the most appropriate thing to do.
If you@@ '@@ re bor@@ ed and use that energy to play gu@@ itar and co@@ ok, it will make you happ@@ y.
But if you watch T@@ V@@ , it may make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child is bor@@ ed and you give him an i@@ P@@ ad, he may not be bor@@ ed any@@ more, but he has@@ n't learned how to enter@@ tain himself@@ , or self regul@@ ate, Professor F@@ en@@ sk@@ e sa@@ id.
And "@@ that self-@@ regulation transfers from one situation to other@@ ," he sa@@ id.
Y@@ our k@@ id does@@ n't just learn to enter@@ tain himself@@ , but gets more self-@@ control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate bor@@ ed@@ om@@ .
Nor should we be too critical of it.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant ch@@ at@@ ter of activity and technology.
Professor East@@ wo@@ od agre@@ ed.
"@@ We fra@@ me it as we need to be bor@@ ed more, but bor@@ ed@@ om is an agon@@ iz@@ ing, res@@ tless desire to be connected with something meaning@@ ful@@ ," he sa@@ id.
What people are really searching for, he said, is a way to un@@ plu@@ g and enjoy down time.
"@@ In an environment where we are constantly over@@ stimul@@ at@@ ed@@ ," he said, "@@ it@@ 's hard to find ways to engage when the no@@ ise shut@@ s down@@ ."
In Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o, No P@@ lay@@ book for New Mari@@ ju@@ ana Law
An@@ th@@ ony O@@ ro@@ z@@ co, 19@@ , a community college student and soccer player in sou@@ the@@ ast@@ ern Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o, is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across this stat@@ e: the poss@@ ession of a few nu@@ g@@ gets of mari@@ ju@@ ana and a pi@@ pe he used to smo@@ ke it.
Mr. O@@ ro@@ z@@ co said that one day in September he and a few friends were driving in Lam@@ ar, on the pla@@ ins near the Kan@@ s@@ as bor@@ der, when they were pulled over.
After the police offic@@ er found mari@@ ju@@ ana in the car@@ , Mr. O@@ ro@@ z@@ co was issued a sum@@ mon@@ s for poss@@ ession and drug par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ ali@@ a - pet@@ ty off@@ enses that each carry a $100 fine - and given a court dat@@ e.
"@@ We get treated like crimin@@ al@@ s@@ ," Mr. O@@ ro@@ z@@ co sa@@ id.
But is he on@@ e?
In the uncertain weeks after Col@@ or@@ ado@@ 's vote to leg@@ alize small amounts of mari@@ ju@@ ana for re@@ cre@@ ational use, the answer in hundreds of minor drug cases depends less on the law than on loc@@ ation.
H@@ und@@ reds of mis@@ de@@ mean@@ or mari@@ ju@@ ana cases are already being dropped here and in Washington State, which approved a similar measu@@ re.
Poli@@ ce depart@@ ments have stopped charg@@ ing adults 21 years and older for sm@@ all-@@ scale poss@@ ession that will be legally sanc@@ tioned once the laws take effect in the coming week@@ s.
But prosecut@@ ors in more conservative prec@@ inc@@ ts in Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o have vo@@ wed to press ahead with existing mari@@ ju@@ ana cases and are still c@@ iting people for poss@@ ession.
At the same time, several tow@@ ns from the Den@@ ver sub@@ ur@@ bs to the Western moun@@ tains are voting to block new, state-@@ lic@@ ens@@ ed retail mari@@ ju@@ ana sh@@ ops from opening in their communities.
"@@ This thing is evol@@ ving so quickly that I don't know what@@ 's going to happen nex@@ t@@ ," said Daniel J. O@@ ates, the police chief in A@@ uror@@ a, just east of Den@@ ver.
Regul@@ ators in Washington State are also sc@@ rat@@ ching their head@@ s.
And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of lic@@ enses for production, manufactur@@ ing, distribution and sales - all by a dead@@ line of Dec@@ . 1, 2013.
They say that Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o, for better or worse, is ahead of most states in regulating mari@@ ju@@ ana, first for medical use and now re@@ cre@@ ation@@ ally.
"@@ Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o has a more regulated market, so they will be a good gu@@ ide@@ ," said Bri@@ an E@@ . S@@ mi@@ th, a spo@@ kes@@ man for the Washington State Li@@ qu@@ or Con@@ tro@@ l Bo@@ ar@@ d.
But no place or system, Mr. Smith conc@@ e@@ ded, can do more than suggest what might work.
"@@ Ther@@ e's no real precedent for us to follow@@ ," he sa@@ id.
Washingt@@ on@@ 's law, called I@@ -@@ 50@@ 2, takes effect on Dec@@ . 6, which also leaves a year of lim@@ b@@ o during which the state lic@@ ens@@ ing system will not yet ex@@ ist, but leg@@ alized poss@@ ession will.
And there are thor@@ n@@ y mechan@@ ical questions that must be resolved during that time, like how to balance the stat@@ e's mandate of "@@ adequate acc@@ ess@@ " to lic@@ ens@@ ed mari@@ ju@@ ana with its prohibi@@ tions on c@@ annabis businesses within 1,000 fe@@ et of a school, par@@ k, play@@ ground or child care cent@@ er.
"@@ No@@ where will it be more difficult to site a lic@@ ens@@ ed c@@ annabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the Se@@ attle met@@ ro@@ poli@@ tan are@@ a@@ ," said Ben Liv@@ ing@@ st@@ on, a spo@@ kes@@ man for the Center for Leg@@ al C@@ annab@@ is, a recently formed research group@@ .
On No@@ v. 2@@ 1, Chief O@@ ates in A@@ uror@@ a sent his officers an e-@@ mail announc@@ ing that the city at@@ tor@@ ney would no longer be prosec@@ uting small mari@@ ju@@ ana violations for anyone 21 years or ol@@ der, and that the police would stop charg@@ ing people for those crimes "@@ effective immedi@@ at@@ el@@ y@@ ."
Chief O@@ ates said that the police would enforce city co@@ des regulating medical mari@@ ju@@ ana gro@@ wer@@ s, and that they would still pursue drug traffick@@ ers and deal@@ ers.
In northern Col@@ or@@ ado@@ 's Wel@@ d Coun@@ ty, the distric@@ t at@@ tor@@ ne@@ y, K@@ en Bu@@ ck, represents a stric@@ ter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue pursuing mari@@ ju@@ ana poss@@ ession cases, mostly as a way to press users into getting treatment.
Right now, 1@@ 19 people face charges of poss@@ essing two oun@@ ces or less of mari@@ ju@@ ana, though many are facing other char@@ ges.
"@@ Our office has an obligation to prosecu@@ te off@@ enses that were crimes at the time they occur@@ red@@ ," Mr. Bu@@ ck said in a stat@@ ement.
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mes@@ a Coun@@ ty, where voters rejected the mari@@ ju@@ ana initi@@ ative.
The police in Gr@@ and J@@ unc@@ tion, the coun@@ t@@ y's largest city, are no longer c@@ iting adults for poss@@ ession of small amoun@@ ts.
The coun@@ t@@ y's distric@@ t at@@ tor@@ ne@@ y, Pe@@ te Hau@@ tz@@ ing@@ er, supported that decision, but also decided not to dismiss all of the pending poss@@ ession cas@@ es.
"@@ I do not think I@@ '@@ m wa@@ sting my time continuing to enforce the law until it chan@@ ges@@ ," he sa@@ id.
Although 55 perc@@ ent of Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o voters supported the measu@@ re, bringing re@@ cre@@ ational mari@@ ju@@ ana into the fol@@ ds of government and the legal system was never going to be simp@@ le.
And the contradictory reactions across the state lay bare a deep ambi@@ valence among local officials about the stat@@ e's big green experi@@ ment.
"@@ It@@ 's a cultural bar@@ rier@@ " with distric@@ t at@@ tor@@ ne@@ ys, said Se@@ an Mc@@ Alli@@ ster, a Den@@ ver lawy@@ er who represents mari@@ ju@@ ana def@@ end@@ ants and is a local spo@@ kes@@ man for the National Organization for the Reform of Mari@@ ju@@ ana Law@@ s.
"@@ They spent so much of their lives prosec@@ uting people that they still don't really accept that this is leg@@ al@@ ," he sa@@ id.
As the first states to treat small amounts of mari@@ ju@@ ana like alco@@ hol@@ , Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o and Washington are poised to become national test cases for drug leg@@ alization.
As advocates and state officials plan for a new frontier of leg@@ alized sal@@ es, they are also anxi@@ ously awa@@ iting direction from the federal government, which still plans to treat the sale and cultiv@@ ation of mari@@ ju@@ ana as federal crimes.
Ad@@ voc@@ ates for leg@@ alized mari@@ ju@@ ana are hoping the Justice Department yiel@@ ds.
Despite some high-@@ profile arres@@ ts of medical mari@@ ju@@ ana patients and sell@@ ers, the federal government has mostly allowed medical mari@@ ju@@ ana businesses to operate in Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o, Washington and 16 other states.
While drug agents will probably not beat down doors to seize a small b@@ ag of the dru@@ g, they are likely to bal@@ k at allowing the state-@@ regulated re@@ cre@@ ational mari@@ ju@@ ana sh@@ ops allowed under the new laws, said K@@ ev@@ in A. Sa@@ be@@ t, a former drug policy advis@@ er in the Obama administration.
Several cities in Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before Elec@@ tion Da@@ y, some local governments approved mor@@ atori@@ ums on any new mari@@ ju@@ ana sh@@ op@@ s, even though it will be about a year before any can op@@ en.
Last week, the western city of Mon@@ tro@@ se took up a six-@@ month b@@ an, and is likely to pass it next week@@ .
"@@ We don't want to be put in a position where we lic@@ en@@ se som@@ eb@@ od@@ y and then have a big federal issu@@ e@@ ," said Bo@@ b Nich@@ ol@@ son, a City Council member@@ .
Our community voted against this amend@@ ment.
We@@ '@@ re looking at what the community voted for versus what the state voted for@@ .
Ther@@ e's an aw@@ ful lot of questions.
Pet@@ ron@@ ell@@ a W@@ y@@ att@@ : I was bul@@ lied out of Ox@@ ford for being a T@@ ory
It is not just today's university students who are attacked for their views
I can@@ 't remember a time when I did@@ n't dream of winning a place at Ox@@ ford Universi@@ ty.
Both my father and my el@@ der bro@@ ther had been at what I imagined was the world's greatest seat of lear@@ ning, a modern@@ -@@ day win@@ e-@@ bl@@ ush@@ ed Greek sy@@ m@@ posi@@ um encouraging the dual pillars of civili@@ s@@ ation, free thinking and toler@@ ance.
Yet, within two weeks of taking up my place at Wor@@ c@@ ester Col@@ lege in the late E@@ igh@@ ties to read history, I@@ '@@ d pack@@ ed my bag@@ s, precipit@@ ating the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and cri@@ ed.
Fri@@ ends were b@@ aff@@ led.
The E@@ ven@@ ing Standard di@@ ary claimed I@@ '@@ d qu@@ it because I objec@@ ted to fellow under@@ gradu@@ ates having sex in the room next to min@@ e.
The wri@@ ter A@@  @@ N Wil@@ son announced wag@@ g@@ ish@@ ly that I@@ '@@ d depar@@ ted because I was forced to drin@@ k out of chi@@ pped mug@@ s.
The truth was less dro@@ ll@@ .
I ran away.
Yes, ran@@ , because I had been subject to systematic bul@@ lying and intimid@@ ation.
Not on account of my rather ou@@ tr@@ é nam@@ e, or the fact that I came from a private school@@ .
I was per@@ sec@@ uted for one reason on@@ ly, and in this cra@@ d@@ le of supposed enlighten@@ ment it was both big@@ o@@ ted and barbar@@ ic@@ : my father, the late Wo@@ o@@ dro@@ w W@@ yat@@ t, was a high-@@ profile advis@@ er to Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative suppor@@ ter.
Why bring this up now, you might as@@ k.
W@@ ell, recent reports suggest that a new generation of Righ@@ t-@@ of-@@ cent@@ re students are suffering a similar persecu@@ tion.
Such is the institution@@ alis@@ ed and increasing hatred of T@@ ory students at Ox@@ ford that last week a group of them demanded the same equ@@ al-@@ rights protection as ga@@ ys, dis@@ ab@@ led people and ethnic minori@@ ties.
Conservative members of Cor@@ p@@ us Christ@@ i Col@@ le@@ ge@@ 's j@@ uni@@ or common room (@@ J@@ C@@ R) claim they are "@@ often actively isol@@ ated, personally attacked and made to feel un@@ welcom@@ e" because of their political view@@ s.
They want to create a post on the colle@@ ge@@ 's equal opportunities committee to ensure that their opini@@ ons can be ai@@ red fre@@ ely.
Their situation was@@ n't helped by a recent BB@@ C Two docum@@ ent@@ ary, W@@ on@@ der@@ land@@ : Yo@@ ung, Bri@@ ght and on the Righ@@ t, about student politics, which portra@@ yed T@@ ories as od@@ d@@ ball@@ s and neo-@@ Naz@@ is.
It feat@@ ured graduate Jo@@ e Co@@ ok@@ e, former president of the Ox@@ ford University Conservative Association (@@ O@@ U@@ CA@@ ), tra@@ v@@ elling in a Roll@@ s-@@ Ro@@ y@@ ce, spor@@ ting a silver suit and sil@@ ver@@ -@@ topp@@ ed can@@ e.
At other universities, Conservative students say they are being treated as "@@ s@@ cap@@ ego@@ ats@@ " for the introduction of higher tui@@ tion fe@@ es@@ ."
Lu@@ ke B@@ lack@@ , 20, vic@@ e-@@ president of No@@ tt@@ ing@@ ham University Conservative Associ@@ ation, told a Sun@@ day newspaper that "@@ there is a growing L@@ ef@@ t-wing bias at universi@@ ties.
People assume we are like the Bul@@ ling@@ d@@ on Club without meeting us@@ ."
Sam@@ uel Ro@@ ber@@ ts, 2@@ 1, a history student at Cor@@ p@@ us Christi@@ , who proposed the motion for greater protection, says such a climate is "@@ un@@ comfort@@ able@@ ," while Ste@@ ph@@ an@@ ie Cher@@ ill@@ , 19@@ , president elect of O@@ U@@ CA@@ , says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of J@@ C@@ R members towards people who are Right of cent@@ re.
"@@ This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discus@@ sion, as well as to the welfare of member@@ s@@ ," she say@@ s.
I was in a minority of one during my first few weeks at Ox@@ for@@ d.
I had gone up in September 198@@ 6, a crip@@ pl@@ ingly sh@@ y 18@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ d.
Hat@@ red of the Conservative Party was at its most f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le.
The year before, the university had voted to refuse Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an hon@@ or@@ ary degre@@ e, because of cuts in higher education fund@@ ing.
The atmosphere would have made a Stalin@@ ist sh@@ ud@@ der with ap@@ prehen@@ sion.
During the first few days of fres@@ her@@ s" week, when new students soci@@ ali@@ se with each other and the don@@ s, I had a ta@@ ste of the wor@@ m@@ wo@@ od that was to come.
I was to find that the d@@ ons not only con@@ ni@@ ved in the ta@@ unting of T@@ ory under@@ gradu@@ ates but took part with reli@@ sh.
The politics of the min@@ ers@@ " strik@@ e, priv@@ atis@@ ation and the government's opposition to sanctions against apar@@ theid South Africa were brought into the wo@@ od-@@ pan@@ elled ro@@ oms of the t@@ ut@@ ori@@ al.
My first one involved translat@@ ing 18@@ th-@@ century French tex@@ ts into Engli@@ sh, and I was un@@ prepared for what follow@@ ed.
"@@ Mis@@ s W@@ y@@ att@@ ," said the d@@ on, Har@@ ry P@@ it@@ t (@@ now dec@@ eas@@ ed@@ ), "@@ ple@@ ase translate the first par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph@@ ."
I st@@ umb@@ led over it.
A small man with a face like c@@ ake bat@@ ter, P@@ it@@ t was big on bi@@ le.
"@@ Do That@@ cher@@ ites refuse to learn French or are they just stup@@ id@@ ?" he deman@@ ded.
The other under@@ gradu@@ ates gi@@ gg@@ led.
T@@ ear@@ s pri@@ cked the back of my ey@@ es.
"@@ I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your sp@@ are time - that is, if you@@ '@@ re not too busy soci@@ alis@@ ing@@ ," P@@ it@@ t s@@ nar@@ led.
I wal@@ ked back to my ro@@ oms a dis@@ con@@ sol@@ ate fig@@ ure.
At d@@ inner in college that ev@@ ening I s@@ at by my@@ self@@ ; then I felt a light tap on my shoul@@ der.
It was a second@@ -year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the O@@ U@@ CA@@ .
"@@ I know who you are@@ ," he said kin@@ d@@ ly.
I@@ '@@ m afraid it@@ 's like that.
Anyone suspected of being a T@@ ory is picked on.
It@@ 's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatch@@ er, so it will be worse for you@@ .
Most T@@ ory fres@@ her@@ s pre@@ tend the@@ y@@ '@@ re Labour@@ .
Lat@@ er, at a local pub@@ , I cra@@ ven@@ ly attempted to dis@@ simul@@ ate.
I insisted that I did@@ n't agree with everything Mr@@ s Thatcher sa@@ id.
This plo@@ y proved un@@ success@@ ful.
A first year PP@@ E stud@@ ent, who, iron@@ ically, had been to Et@@ on, sa@@ id@@ : "@@ You@@ '@@ re the daugh@@ ter of a fasc@@ ist p@@ ig@@ ."
You@@ '@@ re contam@@ in@@ ated.
Other students took up the refra@@ in.
I was per@@ ver@@ ted, dir@@ ty.
"@@ How do T@@ ories have sex@@ ?" one ask@@ ed.
They beat each other, don't the@@ y?
I felt the way homo@@ sexu@@ als must have felt before the liberal legislation of the Six@@ ties.
Would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Ox@@ for@@ d?
Would I be forced to meet lik@@ e-@@ minded people only after dark@@ ?
Would I have to turn to Labour and suppress my natural inc@@ lin@@ ations@@ ?
The three years before me stret@@ ched out as a pur@@ g@@ atory of o@@ strac@@ ism and isol@@ ation.
The only openly T@@ ory d@@ on was Nor@@ man St@@ one, Professor of Modern Histor@@ y, who was based at my colle@@ ge.
He was hat@@ ed for being not only a Conservative but a foreign policy advis@@ er to Thatcher and one of her speech wri@@ ters.
He was hardly ever there.
He lo@@ ath@@ ed the place as provincial and p@@ ett@@ y, and for its adher@@ ence to the Marx@@ ist@@ -@@ determin@@ ist view of history.
In 1997 he took up a profess@@ or@@ ship at the University of Bil@@ k@@ ent, in An@@ kar@@ a, Turkey.
"@@ You won@@ 't be happy here@@ ," he told me.
I began comm@@ uting from Ox@@ ford to my par@@ ents@@ " house in London, finding refu@@ ge with my more open-@@ minded met@@ ro@@ poli@@ tan friends and family.
I told my father I hat@@ ed Ox@@ ford and wh@@ y.
He was incre@@ dul@@ ous.
During his time there in the For@@ ties, all political views had been accep@@ ted.
"@@ But it@@ 's the best place in the world@@ ," he said pa@@ the@@ tic@@ ally.
They wo@@ uld@@ n't do that, not among my dream@@ ing spi@@ res.
Even my Communist friends always had imp@@ ec@@ c@@ able man@@ ner@@ s.
His r@@ he@@ um@@ y eyes began to clou@@ d.
Gi@@ ve it a ch@@ ance.
I@@ '@@ m sure it@@ 's all just a te@@ as@@ e.
It would break my heart if you left.
Ex@@ hau@@ sted by my frequent tri@@ ps to London, my emotional resistance was deterior@@ ating.
A male friend of min@@ e, also a T@@ ory suppor@@ ter, had succum@@ bed to pressure and ren@@ ounced his cre@@ ed.
During a t@@ ut@@ ori@@ al the following week, when another history d@@ on had sugges@@ ted, in complete seri@@ ous@@ ness, that I was an "@@ enemy of the people@@ ," I decided to do the same.
In@@ war@@ dly bl@@ us@@ hing with sham@@ e, I admitted to being "@@ bra@@ in@@ w@@ ash@@ ed by my par@@ ents@@ " and called them "@@ old fool@@ s@@ ."
The resp@@ ite was shor@@ t.
It was my father who drove the n@@ ail into the coff@@ in of my Ox@@ ford care@@ er.
At the time, he wrote two colum@@ ns in the Mur@@ doch press each week@@ .
My door was lock@@ ed.
I co@@ wer@@ ed insi@@ de, and after five min@@ ut@@ es, my pursu@@ ers gave up.
When they left, I pack@@ ed a su@@ it@@ case and caught the first train to London.
I never went back.
You may call me a sni@@ v@@ elling wi@@ mp@@ .
But no 18@@ -@@ year-old should be subject to such intimid@@ ation and vit@@ ri@@ ol in an educational institu@@ tion.
Even more tragic is that it was Ox@@ for@@ d, which not only produced 14 T@@ ory prime ministers, but, to this day, hi@@ des behind an ill-@@ deser@@ ved reputation for equality and freedom of though@@ t.
"@@ Val@@ ent@@ ino pre@@ fers eleg@@ ance to notori@@ et@@ y"
On the occasion of the "@@ Val@@ ent@@ ino@@ : Ma@@ ster of Cou@@ ture@@ ," an exhi@@ bi@@ tion that opened this week in London, AB@@ C speaks with Nat@@ y Ab@@ asc@@ al, Fi@@ on@@ a Th@@ y@@ s@@ sen@@ -@@ Bor@@ n@@ emis@@ za and other of the Italian desig@@ ner@@ 's famous cli@@ ents.
Som@@ er@@ set Hous@@ e, former home of Qu@@ een Eli@@ z@@ abe@@ th I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of ho@@ sting a Val@@ ent@@ ino Gar@@ av@@ ani exhi@@ bi@@ tion.
During the in@@ augu@@ ration of "@@ Val@@ ent@@ ino@@ : Ma@@ ster of Cou@@ ture@@ ," the desig@@ ner acknowledged a retro@@ spec@@ tive apo@@ theo@@ sis that brings together over 130 cou@@ ture go@@ w@@ ns created by his fashi@@ on house over the past 50 years.

This exhi@@ bi@@ tion is the culmin@@ ation of a story whose only pro@@ tagon@@ ist is "@@ sign@@ ore@@ " Gar@@ av@@ ani, although it could not have been written without his distinguished cli@@ ents.
Val@@ ent@@ ino has always been fasc@@ inated by the r@@ are@@ fied and distant world of the no@@ bility.
In the first room of the exhi@@ bi@@ tion, open until March 3, there are a number of private let@@ ters and pho@@ tos signed by the cre@@ am of ar@@ ist@@ o@@ cra@@ cy, from Princ@@ ess S@@ ali@@ mah A@@ ga Kh@@ an, Lord Snow@@ d@@ on, Princ@@ ess Mar@@ ie@@ -@@ Ch@@ ant@@ al of Greece to Margaret of Eng@@ land.
Val@@ ent@@ ino exhi@@ bits these personal memories as if they were tro@@ ph@@ ies of his social as@@ cent from hum@@ ble cou@@ turi@@ er in Vo@@ gh@@ era, northern Italy, to i@@ do@@ l of the international jet@@ -@@ s@@ et.
There is nothing wrong with lo@@ ving ro@@ y@@ al@@ ty.
"@@ At least they don't drop ci@@ gar@@ ette ends on your ma@@ gni@@ fic@@ ent car@@ p@@ et, like some beauti@@ ful po@@ p musi@@ c celeb@@ ri@@ ties do@@ ," says Bar@@ on@@ ess Fi@@ on@@ a Th@@ y@@ s@@ sen@@ -@@ Bor@@ n@@ emis@@ z@@ a.
In the '@@ 60@@ s and '@@ 70@@ s, we both lived in the Al@@ ps and were good friend@@ s.

Val@@ ent@@ ino has always preferred eleg@@ ance to notori@@ et@@ y.
And yet, he is a star@@ .

You could see and feel his "@@ spi@@ rit@@ " in every de@@ tail of the flat and its dec@@ or, the food and the musi@@ c.
"@@ All the gu@@ ests were made to feel important and lo@@ v@@ ed@@ " rec@@ alls the top model, who started working with him during Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture We@@ ek Paris, in 199@@ 5.

Many of these cli@@ ents say your first Val@@ ent@@ ino is like your first lo@@ ve, "@@ impossible to for@@ get@@ ."

"@@ I prefer him to other desig@@ ners because of his femin@@ in@@ ity, his great love of women, and because he enh@@ ances our beau@@ ty@@ " added the former D@@ uch@@ ess of F@@ eri@@ a.

I bought my first Val@@ ent@@ ino d@@ ress to we@@ ar at a party in the cast@@ le bel@@ on@@ ging to my co@@ us@@ in, Prin@@ ce E@@ dou@@ ard de L@@ ig@@ ne.

The last time I saw him was a month ago at a g@@ ala d@@ inner at the Or@@ say Mus@@ e@@ um.
He was on the table of Coun@@ t@@ ess Jacqu@@ el@@ ine de Ri@@ bes@@ , a great friend of min@@ e.
"@@ He was im@@ m@@ ac@@ ul@@ ate, time stands still for him@@ ."
If a pr@@ inc@@ ess says that@@ ...
The har@@ dest job in the world@@ : the human mul@@ es of Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en
For four euro@@ s, the Indonesi@@ an vol@@ can@@ o por@@ ters risk life and lim@@ b carrying 70 kil@@ os of sul@@ ph@@ ur along ste@@ ep stone path@@ s.
There are people for whom work is h@@ ell, and others who - literally - work in h@@ ell.
This is the case of An@@ to Wi@@ j@@ ay@@ a, one of the 400 min@@ ers who make their living taking sul@@ ph@@ ur from the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en vol@@ can@@ o, east of the Indonesi@@ an island of J@@ av@@ a.
To do so, he has to desc@@ end every day to the bottom of the crat@@ er, where the sul@@ ph@@ uro@@ us gas eman@@ ating from the bo@@ wel@@ s of the earth solidi@@ fies on cont@@ act with air@@ .
After breaking off large sul@@ ph@@ ur rock@@ s, which in total can weigh up to 70 k@@ ilo@@ s, he carries them in two b@@ am@@ bo@@ o bask@@ ets on his shoul@@ ders along the ste@@ ep stone path@@ s.
It is only 250 met@@ res to the top of the vol@@ can@@ o, which rises to 2,@@ 3@@ 8@@ 6 met@@ res above sea level, but the exhau@@ sted por@@ ters take over 40 min@@ utes to get there, at sn@@ ail@@ 's pac@@ e, keeping their balance and meas@@ uring their steps carefully to avoid sli@@ pping and falling over the precip@@ ic@@ e.
They know that one sli@@ p could cost them their lives, as happened to a French touri@@ st who plung@@ ed to her death a few years ago on the haz@@ ard@@ ous Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en cli@@ ff@@ s.
The Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en min@@ ers are paid 5 euro cents for each kil@@ o of sul@@ ph@@ ur remo@@ ved.
Once at the top@@ , they make their way past the touri@@ sts who photo@@ gra@@ ph them like circ@@ us mon@@ ke@@ ys and then, lu@@ gging their heavy bas@@ ket@@ s, they walk three kil@@ om@@ et@@ res to the sc@@ ales inst@@ alled by a mining company a little further down, 1,@@ 8@@ 50 met@@ res above sea level.
This is P@@ T N@@ gri@@ m@@ bi Can@@ di, a company which, since 1960@@ , has been exploiting the vol@@ can@@ o, and quite literally its workers, whom it pays 6@@ 6@@ 2 ru@@ pe@@ es (@@ 5 euro cent@@ s) per kil@@ o of sul@@ ph@@ ur@@ .
It then s@@ ells the sul@@ ph@@ ur for 10,000 ru@@ pe@@ es (@@ 8@@ 3 cent@@ s) to the petro@@ chemical industry, as the miner@@ al is widely used in everyday life and is used in the manufac@@ ture of mat@@ ch@@ es, fire@@ work@@ s, co@@ sme@@ tics, dynam@@ ite and even for whit@@ ening su@@ gar@@ .
"@@ We generally carry 70 k@@ ilo@@ s, so we get about 4@@ 6@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es (@@ 3.@@ 8 euro@@ s) a tri@@ p@@ " explains An@@ to, who usually make three tri@@ ps a day.
Each one takes three hours and you end up exhau@@ st@@ ed, but it means he gets 13@@ 8@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es (@@ 1@@ 1.5 euro@@ s) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a pit@@ t@@ ance for such an in@@ human effort, it is three times what he would earn in the field.
"@@ Min@@ ers@@ ' wages are very high here, whereas coff@@ ee har@@ vest@@ ing is paid 15@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es (@@ 1.@@ 2 euro@@ s) a day and the average monthly wage is two million ru@@ pe@@ es (@@ 16@@ 7 euro@@ s) " explains the por@@ ter, who previously worked as a mas@@ on in the island resort of B@@ ali@@ .
Ther@@ e, his wage was 7@@ 5,000 ru@@ pe@@ es (@@ 6.@@ 2 euro@@ s) a day and the work was not as har@@ d, but An@@ to has returned with his family to B@@ any@@ u@@ wan@@ gi@@ , a village near the vol@@ can@@ o, for a compelling reason which, in Indonesia, is as over@@ riding as the sul@@ ph@@ ur@@ : "@@ I married a gir@@ l from B@@ ali@@ , where they are Hin@@ du@@ , and I@@ '@@ ve brought her to J@@ av@@ a to conver@@ t to Islam@@ ."
An@@ to has as@@ th@@ ma, he has difficulty bre@@ ath@@ ing, c@@ ough@@ s constantly and his eyes are ir@@ rit@@ ated by the toxic gas@@ es.
At 27 years old, An@@ to has been risk@@ ing his life for three years in the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en vol@@ can@@ o, and the sul@@ ph@@ ur has already begun to take its toll on him, even though he cover@@ s his face with special mas@@ k and go@@ gg@@ les.
He has as@@ th@@ ma, he has difficulty bre@@ ath@@ ing, c@@ ough@@ s constantly and his eyes are ir@@ rit@@ ated by the toxic gas@@ es from the vol@@ can@@ o.
This is the price you have to pay to reali@@ se your dream@@ s.
"@@ I@@ '@@ ll go on working two more years because I want to open a sho@@ p or study Spanish or Fren@@ ch@@ " he vo@@ ws in more than acceptable Engli@@ sh.
P@@ un@@ ished for life, this pleas@@ ant, intelligent young man could be a t@@ our gu@@ i@@ de, wa@@ it@@ er or ho@@ tel rec@@ ep@@ tion@@ ist, but instead he does the work of a mu@@ le.
Shar@@ ing a fil@@ thy wo@@ o@@ den h@@ ut with other por@@ ters, he gets up every day at two in the mor@@ ning because the sul@@ ph@@ ur does@@ n't stop flowing at nigh@@ t, when its character@@ istic y@@ el@@ low col@@ our turns blu@@ e and it g@@ low@@ s in the dark@@ .
Def@@ ying the shadow@@ s, An@@ to desc@@ ends the crat@@ er and lights the path with a small tor@@ ch attach@@ ed to the hel@@ met he bought with his money.
Some 400 por@@ ters carry sul@@ ph@@ ur bask@@ ets on their shoul@@ ders from the crat@@ er.
Despite their huge prof@@ its, the mining company has not mechanis@@ ed the sul@@ ph@@ ur extrac@@ tion process to save costs, nor has it provided any equipment for the por@@ ters, who work for themselves and by the k@@ ilo@@ .
In fact, they do not even see any of the 30@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ e (@@ 2.5 euro@@ ) per cam@@ era sur@@ charge that, on top of the 15@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ e (@@ 1.@@ 2 euro@@ ) ent@@ ran@@ ce fe@@ e, the guar@@ ds of this natural reserve charge to touri@@ sts who come to photo@@ gra@@ ph the vol@@ can@@ o and their human mul@@ es.
"@@ This work is for anim@@ als, not people@@ " protests Mad@@ rus@@ in, a bur@@ ly 4@@ 2-@@ year por@@ ter who has been working at Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en for three decades, since leaving school@@ .
He can lift up to 1@@ 10 k@@ ilo@@ s, ensuring that he will go on working "@@ all he can@@ " because he needs the money to educ@@ ate his three children, aged between 18 [@@ month@@ s@@ ?@@ ] and 10 years ol@@ d.
I won@@ 't reti@@ re, I@@ '@@ ll die here because the vol@@ can@@ o has been my whole life.
Although the sul@@ ph@@ ur bur@@ ns your thro@@ at and st@@ ings your eyes when the wind suddenly changes and tra@@ ps the min@@ ers in the th@@ ick colum@@ ns of smo@@ ke coming out of the vol@@ can@@ o, they are so har@@ dy that no-@@ one compla@@ ins of serious ill@@ ness@@ es@@ ... apar@@ t, of course, from their common resp@@ ir@@ atory problems, o@@ ste@@ o@@ ar@@ thri@@ ti@@ s, k@@ ne@@ e pain and sor@@ es on the shoul@@ ders, which have been mis@@ shap@@ en by the weight of the bas@@ ket@@ s.
Bal@@ ancing the basket on his back, Un@@ ain@@ ik can only carry 50 kil@@ os now he is 5@@ 3 years ol@@ d.
Every day, he and his fellow workers break off 15 t@@ onn@@ es of sul@@ ph@@ ur from the vol@@ can@@ o, which three l@@ or@@ ries move to the war@@ eh@@ ous@@ e in Tam@@ ans@@ ari@@ , 18 kil@@ om@@ et@@ res away along a go@@ at path that pass@@ es through scru@@ b@@ land.
"@@ I won@@ 't reti@@ re, I@@ '@@ ll die here because the vol@@ can@@ o has been my whole life@@ " says Un@@ ain@@ ik, opening a mou@@ th full of gaps where te@@ eth use to be.
The ol@@ dest of his five children, 30 years old, also works carrying sul@@ ph@@ ur@@ .
Time pass@@ es, but poverty perpetu@@ ates from generation to generation in one of the har@@ dest jobs in the world@@ : the one done by human mul@@ es in the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en vol@@ can@@ o.
Singapore seeks bab@@ ies to save its economy
Singap@@ ore@@ ans blame their care@@ ers, stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
"@@ Singap@@ ore@@ 's population needs to grow@@ ."
I@@ '@@ m a patrio@@ tic hus@@ b@@ and, you@@ '@@ re my patrio@@ tic wi@@ fe, let@@ 's do our civic duty and create life@@ !
It may seem unlikely that these ver@@ ses are part of an adver@@ t for min@@ t swe@@ ets, but in sp@@ ite of this - or perhaps because of it - the video went vi@@ ral on You@@ Tu@@ be in Singapore earlier this year.
The phra@@ ses are part of a ra@@ p and make use of local refer@@ ences such as "@@ L@@ et@@ 's put a ba@@ o (@@ bun@@ ) in the o@@ ven@@ " to make fu@@ n of the birth rate in Singap@@ or@@ e.
The adverti@@ sing company that made the vide@@ o, BB@@ H@@ , is hop@@ eful that the adver@@ tis@@ ement will manage to focus attention to the problem in a fu@@ n way.
Its creative direc@@ tor, D@@ ou@@ gl@@ as Hamil@@ ton, says he wanted to use the power of musi@@ c to make people perform their "@@ national d@@ ut@@ y@@ ."
It@@ 's purely an Internet thing, so we had to make it fu@@ n and am@@ us@@ ing.
It@@ 's the biggest problem facing this country.
We are the world's worst at re@@ producing our own pro@@ gen@@ y, so we felt it was an issue we had to addres@@ s.
We knew the Government had tried many things, like launching perf@@ um@@ es with pher@@ om@@ ones or organis@@ ing speed d@@ ating even@@ ings.
Many of these ideas may have been cre@@ ative, but they did@@ n't necessarily work.
So we though@@ t: why not be as creative as possible to solve the problem, by com@@ posing a rap@@ ?
1.@@ 2 children
But the Singapore Government is not taking it so ligh@@ tly.
It spends USD 1,@@ 300 per year on policies to encourage people to have more children.
A government package for marri@@ ages and parents gran@@ ts up to USD 15@@ ,000 per chil@@ d, extends mat@@ ern@@ ity leave and distribut@@ es tax benefits.
But this has all had little effect.
Singapore is a rich, high technology city State in Southeast Asia, also known for the conserv@@ ati@@ sm of its leaders and its strict social control@@ s.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population divi@@ sion, currently stands at 1.@@ 2 children per wom@@ an.
The last time it was over 2, known as the replacement rate, was in 197@@ 6.
So why are Singap@@ ore@@ ans not having children@@ ?
T@@ an W@@ ei M@@ ing, Director of Mar@@ ri@@ age and Fam@@ ily Policy of the National Pop@@ ulation Divi@@ sion, said that it is a result of "@@ better educ@@ ation@@ " and "@@ a wider range of career opportuni@@ ti@@ es@@ ."
"@@ This has given people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priori@@ ties, beyond getting married and starting a famil@@ y" he expla@@ in@@ s.
These changes in social norms have contributed to increasing numbers of people who are sing@@ le, and dela@@ ying marriage and birth@@ s, which has resulted in a decrease in the birth rate in Singap@@ or@@ e.
Meanwhile, an EU immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to cope with the population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are we@@ b@@ sites where xenophobi@@ a against many new immigrants is widespread and thin@@ ly disgu@@ is@@ ed, especially the Chinese who are critic@@ ised for keeping wages low and not integ@@ rat@@ ing.
Increas@@ ed immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why, last year, the Singapore ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest taxes and le@@ vi@@ es for foreign workers.
U@@ nex@@ pec@@ ted consequences
While a fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation@@ 's economic growth, tax revenu@@ es, health@@ care costs and immigration policies, in Singap@@ ore@@ 's case there are also some unexpected consequences.
The Government is trying not to build so many small hous@@ es.
For example, it has started to influence the real estate sector.
Its urban development authority has started to control the number of small apar@@ t@@ ments, known as "@@ sho@@ e box@@ es@@ ," which can be built in certain areas of the c@@ ity.
These apar@@ t@@ ments have a surface of 4@@ 6 square met@@ res and have been very successful in terms of sal@@ es.
However, there is concern that they may promote a single-@@ living lifesty@@ le and discourage develop@@ ers who want to build large family hous@@ es.
But, L@@ im Y@@ ew So@@ on, managing director of the real estate company EL Dev@@ el@@ oper@@ s, says his "@@ sho@@ e box@@ es@@ " sell much faster than larger un@@ its.
They are more popul@@ ar, in the sense that the units sell days, even weeks, faster than larger un@@ its.
This means they are much better for our cash flow@@ .
However, he ad@@ mits that the new regulations give clear@@ er guidance to develop@@ ers, who previously had obstacles put in their way if they provided for too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city Stat@@ e.
Although these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, when talking to Singap@@ ore@@ ans working in the central financial distric@@ t, it seems they will not have much impact.
"@@ People are very stres@@ sed, houses are expensive and so is education, so a lot of people are putting off having a famil@@ y" says a young execu@@ tive.
Other people can have children.
"@@ But, for me, it is important to have my own money and time@@ " says another young man of around 20 years ol@@ d.
M@@ en and women alike mention their care@@ ers, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children.
So, much as the Government is trying to encourage its citizens to have children, when it comes to bab@@ ies, the Singap@@ ore@@ ans have the last wor@@ d.
What is private off@@ line is private online
Priv@@ acy.
According to the Spanish Royal Academy Di@@ c@@ tion@@ ary, it means the quality of private life or "the level of priv@@ acy which a person is entitled to protect from any interfer@@ enc@@ e@@ ."
What is priv@@ acy for an under 16@@ ?
How do you apply this definition to their daily life and social network@@ s?
Do they understand the dangers they are exposed to by air@@ ing information over the Internet which they probably would not share off@@ lin@@ e?
El@@ Peri@@ ó@@ dic@@ o inter@@ viewed five children aged between ten and 15 years old who are frequent Internet us@@ ers.
In four cases, they associated the term with "@@ something very much min@@ e" on a personal level, and "@@ in the us@@ er name and pass@@ wor@@ d@@ " when applied to social network@@ s.
"@@ I wo@@ uld@@ n't up@@ lo@@ ad my deep@@ est secre@@ ts in a post@@ " says J@@ or@@ ge, aged ten, when trying to explain the meaning of priv@@ acy on sites such as Facebo@@ ok, Twit@@ ter, Ho@@ t@@ mail and Win@@ dow@@ s Li@@ ve M@@ essen@@ ger, with which he has had accounts for two years.
"@@ They are very secret secre@@ ts, I@@ '@@ ll tell my mo@@ ther, but not every@@ bo@@ dy@@ " he say@@ s.
On F@@ B I up@@ lo@@ ad ni@@ ce pic@@ tures or gam@@ es.
And I have fu@@ n with people I know@@ .
"@@ I wo@@ uld@@ n't share a pho@@ to that is@@ n't min@@ e, or that belong@@ s to som@@ eb@@ od@@ y wh@@ o@@ 's doing something stup@@ id@@ " he say@@ s.
The child reco@@ g@@ nis@@ es that it is bad to post ob@@ scene pic@@ tures of n@@ aked people, cri@@ mes, or write humili@@ ating or aggressive com@@ ments.
J@@ or@@ ge says he knows the 35 friends he has on F@@ B and his nine followers on Twit@@ ter.
Most are rel@@ atives.
His mother is inclu@@ ded, and she has the pass@@ word to one of the accoun@@ ts.
I opened Twitter to express my@@ self and post interesting t@@ we@@ ets.
"@@ I don't know if they answer me, I only up@@ lo@@ ad them@@ " he add@@ s.
"@@ Social net@@ working is f@@ un, I can talk quickly to rel@@ atives far away or my friend@@ s" he say@@ s.
He does not hesit@@ ate to rep@@ ly that he would never accept a request from an unknown person@@ .
Nor would he take any notice of someone who recommen@@ ds a stran@@ ger to him.
The case of Jose@@ ph@@ , aged 1@@ 4, is different.
This te@@ en@@ ager has accounts with Ho@@ t@@ ma@@ il, Facebo@@ ok, My Sp@@ ace and A@@ sk@@ , and in the last case he ad@@ mits not knowing 20 of the people added to his friends li@@ st.
"@@ It does@@ n't bo@@ ther me, because we have something in common@@ , like musi@@ c@@ " he say@@ s.
The bo@@ y says that no-@@ one has suggested anything to him or asked him for his home address or phone num@@ ber.
"@@ If they pressu@@ red me or asked me for it, I@@ '@@ d just del@@ ete them from my account@@ " he states.
Joseph became a follow@@ er on A@@ sk@@ , after reading a recommend@@ ation on Twit@@ ter.
This te@@ en@@ ager is not alien to experiences of what is now known as cy@@ ber@@ bul@@ ly@@ ing.
An acqu@@ ain@@ t@@ ance of a friend of min@@ e was being pes@@ tered on a social net@@ work.
They were threatening him and demanding money from him.
"@@ I never found out who it was@@ " he say@@ s.
The victim@@ , according to Jos@@ é@@ , did not close his accoun@@ t.
"@@ He just made it priv@@ ate@@ ."
He then explains a series of steps to conf@@ ig@@ ure the account saf@@ ely.
Unlike J@@ or@@ ge, this bo@@ y would up@@ lo@@ ad pho@@ tos of acqu@@ ain@@ t@@ ances in un@@ comfortable or embarrass@@ ing situ@@ ations.
I would do it if I did@@ n't like som@@ eb@@ od@@ y, or they made me want to do it.
"@@ However, I know that@@ 's cy@@ ber@@ bul@@ ly@@ ing@@ " he ad@@ mit@@ s.
K@@ ey questions
Mar@@ iel@@ os Por@@ ra@@ s, an English teach@@ er with a degree in Education and L@@ earn@@ ing, believes that to guide children and te@@ enag@@ ers, they should understand that the purpose of social media is to inform@@ .
"@@ The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the appearance of these we@@ b@@ si@@ tes, the rules of the game chan@@ ged@@ " he say@@ s.
Por@@ ra@@ s says the schol@@ ar Mar@@ c P@@ ren@@ sky, with a Ma@@ ster@@ 's degree in Education from Yale University and author of the work Dig@@ ital N@@ atives, Dig@@ ital Immig@@ ran@@ ts, co@@ ined these terms to explain the phenomen@@ on.
Dig@@ ital n@@ atives are those children and young people born with technology.
"@@ We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, when we are still in fact lear@@ n@@ ing@@ " he say@@ s.
He says that the issue is complex, "@@ because we are asking them to have a clear policy on what is appropriate or not to disclo@@ se, publi@@ sh or di@@ vul@@ ge, at an age at which mat@@ urity is not condu@@ cive to this@@ ."
"@@ They also have to be selec@@ tive when what matters most is to be popular and have thousands of friend@@ s, without thinking of the consequ@@ enc@@ es@@ " he add@@ s.
According to the speci@@ alist, the most effective way to teach children and te@@ enag@@ ers what priv@@ acy is, is through questions that make them thin@@ k.
"@@ T@@ elling them not to do it is no good@@ " he add@@ s.
Por@@ ra@@ s then li@@ sts some op@@ tions: There are things you wo@@ uld@@ n't tell a stran@@ ger, so why do it on@@ lin@@ e?
Or@@ , would you like a friend to publi@@ sh a pho@@ to of you like the one you post@@ ed of a friend@@ ?
Do you know what others publi@@ sh about you@@ ?
When tag@@ ging party photo@@ s, did you ask the other people@@ 's per@@ mission to tag them@@ ?
And one more question: does everyone need to know what you@@ '@@ re doing all the time@@ ?
Another point is to make them see that they must behave online as they do off@@ line.
The rules are the same.
"@@ Out@@ side the Internet, people act with respect, morality and other principl@@ es, so they should act the same way on social network@@ s" he say@@ s.
Mon@@ it@@ oring

Un@@ as@@ ur Summit clos@@ es without making public the Lim@@ a Declaration
The Six@@ th Presiden@@ tial Summit of the South American Union of Nations (@@ Un@@ as@@ ur@@ ) concluded today in Peru without making public the Lim@@ a Declar@@ ation, previously announced and theore@@ tically signed by the seven atten@@ de@@ e leaders.
E@@ fe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the Six@@ th U@@ NA@@ S@@ U@@ R Me@@ eting of He@@ ads of State and Govern@@ ment, but Presiden@@ tial and Chancell@@ ery sources initially said they would deliver it after the summit clos@@ ed, but later they claimed that it will be published at some point on the Per@@ u@@ vi@@ an Government we@@ b@@ si@@ te.
When asked about the tex@@ t, they pointed out that the content had been disc@@ los@@ ed by Per@@ u@@ vi@@ an Presid@@ ent, O@@ ll@@ anta Hum@@ al@@ a, during a brief statement to the pres@@ s.
Journ@@ alist@@ s' access to information from the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the summit, in the press room@@ , only video was ai@@ red, with no so@@ und, showing the presidential meeting with the message "@@ closed s@@ ession, audi@@ o restric@@ ted@@ ."
The little information that circul@@ ated among repor@@ ters was given by the press spo@@ kes@@ men of some of the U@@ NA@@ S@@ U@@ R governments atten@@ ding the meeting, but not the Per@@ u@@ vi@@ an Govern@@ ment.
The only document released during the summit was the list of atten@@ ding presid@@ ents, which ang@@ ered hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, who asked for more detail@@ s.
The Per@@ u@@ vi@@ an President then sent an em@@ ail to the media with the "@@ final stat@@ ement@@ " of the summit, but this was Hum@@ al@@ a's stat@@ ement, and not the official document that closed the summit@@ .
Last October, Peru ho@@ sted the Third Summit of South American-@@ Arab Countries (@@ AS@@ PA@@ ), and this time, despite repeated requ@@ ests from the press, the previously announced Lim@@ a Declaration was again not made public.
The AS@@ P@@ A official we@@ b@@ site con@@ firms that the document was published last Tu@@ es@@ day.
At both international events, the Per@@ u@@ vi@@ an authorities were at pain@@ s to ensure that there were broadcast@@ ing systems assured for all the journ@@ alists, but limited the ob@@ taining of information to a maxim@@ um.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the H@@ ague Court to ad@@ ju@@ dic@@ ate a border dispute between the two countries.
The Presid@@ ents of Peru, O@@ ll@@ anta Hum@@ al@@ a, and Chile, Seb@@ asti@@ á@@ n Pi@@ ñ@@ era, met during the regional event and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice (@@ IC@@ J@@ ), which on Mon@@ day, at The H@@ agu@@ e, will start to hear the arguments of both parties, in the law@@ suit Lim@@ a has fil@@ ed against S@@ anti@@ ago.
"@@ We will o@@ be@@ y and exec@@ ute the order that currently defin@@ es the differences we are bringing before this international cour@@ t" said Hum@@ al@@ a, together with his Chi@@ lean counterpar@@ t.
"@@ Chile has be@@ en, is and will remain a country that respec@@ ts international law and the peaceful resolution of disput@@ es, treaties and international cour@@ ts@@ " added Pi@@ ñ@@ era, gre@@ eting Hum@@ ala with a hand@@ shak@@ e, alongside the flag@@ s of the two countries.
Con@@ firm@@ ation of both presidents that they would sub@@ mit to the IC@@ J came after Colombia this week denounced the Bo@@ go@@ t@@ á P@@ act, whereby it accepted to sub@@ mit to the jud@@ gement of this international cour@@ t, following a decision on its maritime bound@@ ary with Nicaragu@@ a which it regarded as seriously flaw@@ ed.
The summit was held with the absence of the Presid@@ ents of Brazil, D@@ il@@ ma Rousse@@ ff@@ ; Venezuela, Hugo Cha@@ ve@@ z@@ ; Bolivi@@ a, E@@ vo Moral@@ es; and Argentina, Cri@@ stin@@ a Kir@@ chn@@ er.
Par@@ agu@@ a@@ y, which was suspended by U@@ NA@@ S@@ U@@ R in 2011 after the dis@@ miss@@ al of former President Fern@@ and@@ o Lu@@ go, was not involved in the meet@@ ing.
Ho@@ st President O@@ ll@@ anta Hum@@ ala was responsible for opening the s@@ ession in the mor@@ ning and closing the summit, just after no@@ on in Li@@ ma.
The President read the final document which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the action plans laid down for 31 projects between the South American countries, for a total of 17 billion dollars of investments.
Among the resolu@@ tions adop@@ ted, it was mentioned that U@@ NA@@ S@@ U@@ R countries will take "@@ important steps toward the goal of a South American citizen@@ ship, for which residen@@ ce agreements are being exten@@ ded@@ ."
He reported that actions are being implemented to improve "@@ cooperation in the fight against insecurity and transnational organis@@ ed crime, actions to make medic@@ ation more accessi@@ ble, low-cost Internet access in all areas of South America, and to deal join@@ tly and effici@@ ently with risks of natural disaster@@ s@@ ."
With Europe in crisis, "@@ economic consolidation (in Latin Americ@@ a) should not have a tri@@ ump@@ ha@@ list attitude but should serve to expand its productive mat@@ ri@@ x and gli@@ mp@@ se a better future for its people@@ " Hum@@ ala ad@@ ded.
"@@ We decided to focus on a group of 31 flag@@ ship projects that will improve connection among areas of South America, especially in rural and border areas@@ ... un@@ iting our countries and creating new economic network@@ s" said the Per@@ u@@ vi@@ an President in a message read out.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five are in Peru and are located in the trans@@ verse ax@@ es of its territory, between the coast and Brazil, and two focus on increased connection with Ecuad@@ or, although he gave no further detail@@ s.
Al@@ so, the final document mentioned the political situation in Par@@ agu@@ a@@ y.
"@@ We hope the electoral process in that country serves to re@@ incorpor@@ ate it in the Union of South American Nation@@ s@@ ," from which it is currently exclu@@ ded.
The need for Latin America to remain a prosper@@ ous, peaceful and integrated nation, with good neigh@@ bour@@ ly relations, was another issue highlighted by the summit@@ .
In this sense, the President of Colombi@@ a, Ju@@ an Manuel San@@ to@@ s, said before atten@@ ding the start of the regional event that he expected to meet with his counter@@ part from Nicaragu@@ a, Daniel Or@@ teg@@ a, on Sat@@ ur@@ day in Mexico, to respec@@ t@@ fully discuss the maritime dispute after the failure of the IC@@ J@@ , ques@@ tioned by Bo@@ go@@ ta@@ .
"@@ The day after tomor@@ row (S@@ atur@@ da@@ y) I might have a meeting with President Daniel Orte@@ ga@@ " San@@ tos sa@@ id.
"@@ We will review all these path@@ s, [@@ wh@@ ich@@ ] are not exclu@@ sive, and the treaty with Nicaragu@@ a will require a convers@@ ation with Nicaragu@@ a@@ " he emphasi@@ sed.
"@@ With President Or@@ teg@@ a, I hope I can say that we handle this in the most civili@@ sed and respec@@ tful manner possi@@ ble@@ " said San@@ to@@ s.
San@@ tos and Ortega are due to meet on Sat@@ ur@@ day in Mexico, where they expect to attend the in@@ augu@@ ration of the country's new Presid@@ ent, En@@ ri@@ que Pe@@ ñ@@ a Ni@@ et@@ o.
Al@@ so, as part of the summit, the blo@@ c@@ 's foreign def@@ ence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on def@@ ence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivi@@ a, Colombi@@ a, Ecuad@@ or, Peru, Brazil, Urugu@@ a@@ y, Venezuela, Chile, Gu@@ y@@ ana, Sur@@ in@@ am and Par@@ agu@@ ay make up U@@ NA@@ S@@ UR@@ , although the latter is currently suspen@@ ded.
Peru has the pro tempor@@ e presidency of the regional blo@@ c.
"@@ South America should learn from Europe to integrate citizen@@ ship@@ " says Raf@@ ael Cor@@ re@@ a
The President of Ecuad@@ or, Raf@@ ael Cor@@ re@@ a, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that "@@ South America, in this case, must learn from Europe@@ ."
Cor@@ re@@ a, who took part in the Ele@@ vent@@ h Presiden@@ tial Summit of the Union of South American Nations (@@ U@@ NA@@ S@@ UR@@ ) held in Li@@ ma, told Per@@ u@@ 's state television that Europeans "@@ killed one another in the Second World War@@ " and other conflicts, "@@ but are now practically one country@@ ."
To this end, he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by member countries of U@@ NA@@ S@@ UR@@ .
"@@ We have to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country, as is already the situation with members of the An@@ de@@ an Commun@@ ity. However, there are still reac@@ tionary sectors that want us to return to the past@@ " he sa@@ id.
The Ecuad@@ ori@@ an President was also in fa@@ v@@ our of the restructuring of the Organisation of American States (@@ O@@ AS@@ ) under the pre@@ mise of reducing the influence of the Anglo@@ -S@@ ax@@ on states and taking into account those who have signed the Pact of San José on human rights.
Those who speak with authority never commit to anything, whereas we South Americans sign every@@ thing.
"@@ It is incom@@ prehen@@ sible that the Inter@@ -American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US fund@@ ing@@ " he said refer@@ ring to Ecu@@ ador giving political asylum to WikiLe@@ aks founder Juli@@ an Ass@@ ange@@ .
Cor@@ re@@ a said he does not regre@@ t that decision because with it he has not betra@@ yed his principl@@ es, but has respected his "@@ deep democratic and human rights valu@@ es@@ ."
He added that, at the time, "@@ he had reasonable suspicion that Ass@@ ange would be ex@@ tradi@@ ted to another country and that his case would not be respec@@ ted@@ ."
Ad@@ di@@ tion@@ ally, he critic@@ ised the Swedish courts for demanding that he be subject to ques@@ tioning for an alleged sexual off@@ ence in his country, when "@@ Swedish legislation itself dict@@ ates that he can be ques@@ tioned via vide@@ o@@ confer@@ ence, which could be done from the Ecuad@@ ori@@ an Em@@ b@@ ass@@ y in London@@ ."
Cor@@ re@@ a said that there is a risk of deterioration of Ass@@ ange@@ 's physical and mental health.
"@@ I have not spoken to him since he was at our emb@@ ass@@ y, but the ambassador informed me that he had a minor lung problem, nothing seri@@ ous@@ " said the Ecuad@@ ori@@ an Presid@@ ent.
What there is, is the danger that his physical and mental health may deterior@@ ate due to being locked in a small space without any out@@ door exercis@@ e.
"@@ That would complic@@ ate the health of any person@@ " he ad@@ ded.
Cor@@ re@@ a said that the solution to the asylum granted to Ass@@ ange in June by the Ecuad@@ ori@@ an Em@@ b@@ ass@@ y, in London, through the issue of a saf@@ e-@@ conduct pass that per@@ mits travel to Ecuad@@ or, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities, and stressed that there have been talks with London to seek a solution to the imprison@@ ment of the WikiLe@@ aks founder@@ .
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discus@@ sions.
"@@ The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities, because Ass@@ ange@@ 's lawy@@ er, Bal@@ ta@@ z@@ ar Gar@@ z@@ on, is handling a series of cases in different European cour@@ ts@@ " he sa@@ id.
And he felt that "@@ if Britain says no to the saf@@ e-@@ conduct pas@@ s, it@@ 's over@@ ."
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly well allows it to do, and as it has done in other cases, questions M@@ r Ass@@ ange at the Em@@ b@@ ass@@ y of Ecu@@ ador in London, or inter@@ rog@@ ates him via Sk@@ yp@@ e tomorrow@@ , this problem is over.
Cor@@ re@@ a took the opportunity to reas@@ ser@@ t himself as a def@@ ender of freedom of the press and stated that what he does not tolerate is "the medi@@ o@@ cri@@ ty, dish@@ on@@ esty and lies that undermine the freedom of expres@@ sion@@ ."
"@@ The greatest enemies of the press freedom are not evil and wick@@ ed politicians, but bad journalists depending on prof@@ it, black@@ mail and ex@@ tor@@ tion@@ " he sa@@ id.
In that regar@@ d, he welcomed the fact that it was no longer these journ@@ alists, "@@ or the bankers or bour@@ geo@@ is and hegemon@@ ic countries that dominate Ecuad@@ or@@ " and said that, if re-@@ elec@@ ted, he will "@@ step up the revolution to continue on the same path and in the right direc@@ tion@@ ."
Cor@@ re@@ a also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Par@@ agu@@ ay in U@@ NA@@ S@@ UR@@ , at least until their next elections, arguing that the body "@@ must be firm and not tolerate opportun@@ ism and a coup mas@@ ked with leg@@ alit@@ y" because this will in fact "@@ destroy the legitimacy of Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an democracy@@ ."
The Ecuad@@ ori@@ an President also considered the "@@ perfectly per@@ tin@@ ent@@ " desire of his Colombi@@ an counter@@ part, Ju@@ an Manuel San@@ to@@ s, to now negotiate with Nicaragu@@ a the maritime bound@@ ary between the two countries, after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The H@@ agu@@ e, in fa@@ v@@ our Nicaragu@@ an maritime sovereignty.
For now that ruling is not being follow@@ ed.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one.
Con@@ f@@ lic@@ t is inevit@@ able, but must be overcome by the desire to walk together.
They need to be proc@@ essed in a comprehensive manner to overcome them and move forward.
Ad@@ di@@ tion@@ ally, he trusted in a sound conclusion to the maritime bound@@ ary dispute opposing Peru and Chile in the same court and said that "@@ it is right for Latin America to ref@@ er to international courts if both countries agree to accept los@@ ing, however hard it may be@@ ."
With reference to the possibility of his standing as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecu@@ ador seeking a third con@@ secu@@ tive term, he said he sees that possibility "@@ with much optimism and jo@@ y, although at times it is pretty hard@@ ."
Cor@@ re@@ a said that if he loses the elections in February 2013, he will reti@@ re from public life.
Person@@ ally, I@@ '@@ ve never been interested in power, but in situations as un@@ just as those in Ecuad@@ or, soci@@ o-@@ economic poverty can only be correc@@ ted by political power.
"@@ My political movement believed that it was me who ensu@@ red that prob@@ able vic@@ tory, so we have to accept that responsi@@ bilit@@ y" he sa@@ id.
If I w@@ on, it would be my last period in office and then I would leave public life.
If I lo@@ se, lik@@ ewi@@ se.
"@@ It@@ 's a decision@@ " he confirm@@ ed.
Cor@@ re@@ a also referred to Venezuel@@ an President Hugo Cha@@ ve@@ z@@ 's new health treatment in Cub@@ a.
I just spoke with Venezuel@@ an Vice President Nic@@ ol@@ á@@ s Mad@@ uro and he tells me that Cha@@ vez went for treatment that was already plan@@ ned, routine treatment, and it was expected he would win the campaign and return to Cub@@ a.
"@@ This does not mean a health rel@@ ap@@ se for President Cha@@ ve@@ z@@ " he sa@@ id.
In Lim@@ a today, the Ecuad@@ ori@@ an He@@ ad of State attended the Six@@ th Summit of He@@ ads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (@@ U@@ NA@@ S@@ UR@@ ), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
De@@ ath@@ s caused by AIDS are nowadays due to late detec@@ tion
Fabri@@ zi@@ o was 21 years old when they confirmed his test resul@@ t: HIV posi@@ tive.
"@@ It was like a bomb dropped on me@@ " he say@@ s, rec@@ alling the time of the announc@@ ement, which the doc@@ tor was trying to make "@@ sof@@ ter@@ ," apparently un@@ success@@ ful@@ ly.
The bo@@ y h@@ id it from his family.
He decided to care for his illness alone and began to learn about it@@ ; thanks to his efforts he has just celeb@@ rated his 4@@ 3@@ r@@ d birth@@ day.
He is undoubtedly one of the ol@@ dest patients in the HIV Un@@ it of the Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara Civil Ho@@ sp@@ ital (C@@ H@@ G@@ ), where he arrived in 1994 after several battles with his health.
Fabri@@ zi@@ o has lived with the human immun@@ o@@ defici@@ ency virus (@@ HIV@@ ) for 22 years, hard to imagine in the early '@@ 90@@ s, when there were many ques@@ tions, few treatment options and a great deal of stig@@ ma.
Then, even the director of an IM@@ S@@ S [@@ Mexican Social Security Institu@@ te@@ ] clin@@ ic refused to di@@ schar@@ ge him "@@ because he had a cut@@ ."
At that time, having A@@ ids was sy@@ non@@ y@@ mous with death.
Now it is possible to survive the syn@@ dro@@ me and do so with quality of life.
However, many people are still un@@ aware of their ill@@ ness, and only seek help when the virus has already caused ha@@ voc@@ , "@@ exhau@@ st@@ ed@@ " their immune systems and they are suffering from opportun@@ istic infec@@ tions.
31 years after of the onset of AIDS around the world, at least since the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time is that the life expectancy of patients starting treatment in good time and the life expectancy of the general population is exactly equ@@ al@@ " stated the head of the CH@@ G HIV Un@@ it, J@@ aim@@ e An@@ dra@@ de V@@ ill@@ anu@@ ev@@ a, saying that this information was endorsed in April this year in a pres@@ ti@@ gi@@ ous scientific journ@@ al.
In@@ f@@ ec@@ tious disease speci@@ alist and expert in HIV/@@ AIDS, An@@ dra@@ de V@@ ill@@ anu@@ ev@@ a said that since 2008 scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a death sent@@ ence, but that life expectancy and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system that patients present when they are diagno@@ sed, with a higher life expectancy for non-@@ drug us@@ er@@ s: up to 30 years for patients with a 200 CD@@ 4 count and 50 years for those reporting a 500 CD@@ 4 coun@@ t.
In simple terms, this means that anyone diagno@@ sed HIV positive at 25 years old, under these terms and "@@ as long as they keep it under control, can live with no problems to 7@@ 5@@ " said the inter@@ vi@@ e@@ we@@ e.
To g@@ au@@ ge this progress, it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mex@@ ic@@ ans today is 7@@ 6 years.
Although mortality has dropped significantly in recent years and, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has fallen from 6,@@ 6@@ 7@@ 8 in 2007 to 4,@@ 8@@ 6@@ 2 in 2011 (@@ U@@ NA@@ ID@@ S annual report@@ ), it is also true that since the adv@@ ent of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients in the national dat@@ ab@@ ase have di@@ ed.
In J@@ ali@@ sc@@ o alone, only 25@@ 5 people died in 2011, and there have been 18@@ 7 deaths up to May of this year@@ ; however, we are assured that there has been universal access to anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs since 2005.
- Why are do still deaths occur@@ ?
- I think the problem is not to do with access to treatment.
That@@ 's how I view it, and that@@ 's how it@@ 's been at our hospit@@ al.
For at least the last 12 years we@@ '@@ ve had no shortage of medic@@ ine, the problem is that patients arri@@ ve in an advanced state of illness because they are un@@ aware of their HIV status, that is to say, the later stages of the disease.
He gave a compelling statisti@@ c@@ : "@@ N@@ ine out of ten patients arri@@ ve when they already have an opportun@@ istic infec@@ tion, so what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagno@@ ses and, therefore, offer mass detec@@ tion tests for everyone who needs them. "
Speci@@ alists and officials of the State Council of AIDS Pre@@ vention in J@@ ali@@ sc@@ o (@@ CO@@ ES@@ ID@@ A) agree on this propos@@ al, as do the patients themselves, such as Fabri@@ zi@@ o, who came to be tested at a private labor@@ ator@@ y, motivated only because a friend had done so and, despite his young age, he was around in the AIDS era and had even suffered Ka@@ pos@@ i sar@@ com@@ a, a canc@@ erous tum@@ our that is one of the common complic@@ ations.
Every@@ thing changes when you know you have AIDS@@ .
Some people think the@@ y@@ '@@ re going to die and don't want to know any@@ thing.
"@@ If I@@ '@@ m going to die, I@@ '@@ d rather have a b@@ low-@@ out three times a week@@ " they say, but not in my case.
The change was for the bet@@ ter@@ ; I eat well, I exercis@@ e, I take my drug@@ s.
To dat@@ e, his parents are only aware he had canc@@ er.
I live as normal a life as anyone else.
"@@ I work, I take part in a lot of activities, I travel@@ , I have an active but responsible sex life, I take care of my@@ self and the other person@@ " said Fabri@@ zi@@ o, who agreed to share his intim@@ ate secre@@ ts with MI@@ L@@ EN@@ I@@ O J@@ AL@@ IS@@ CO@@ , to motiv@@ ate those people with his story who today, in the context of World AIDS Da@@ y, are afra@@ id.
They should get tested if they are at risk. because the sooner they know if they are HIV posi@@ tive, the better, and if they have already been diagno@@ sed, they must learn to live like any other person@@ , while being responsi@@ ble.
This is his messa@@ ge, which summ@@ arises the them@@ e of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Con@@ dom@@ s behind the counter@@ .
The gaps between health programm@@ es and ordinary citizens are hu@@ ge, said Ric@@ ar@@ do Sal@@ az@@ ar, a journalist from Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara who has taken up the HIV cause.
And the greatest cure is preven@@ tion.
In places dedicated to this task "the distribution of con@@ dom@@ s has actually increas@@ ed; pre@@ viously, they used to give us one or two@@ , now they give us pack@@ ets of a hund@@ red, and that@@ 's fin@@ e, but it turns out there are still people out there who have no access con@@ dom@@ s" he sa@@ id.
Among the most vulnerable to new infec@@ tions are te@@ enag@@ ers.
"@@ Why do you want them@@ ?" is a common question, asked with sar@@ cas@@ m and judged according to the values of social workers, coun@@ sell@@ ors, p@@ harm@@ acy workers and health@@ care staff who do not want to expose te@@ enag@@ ers to sex@@ , said the speak@@ er.
It was decided to change such inefficient alloc@@ ation, and that con@@ dom@@ s should not only be placed behind counter@@ s, but that pack@@ ets of one hundred should be found in public to@@ i@@ let disp@@ en@@ ser@@ s in places frequ@@ ented by young people.
This is not promoting promis@@ cu@@ ity.
It is not about paying for their be@@ ers or mo@@ tel fe@@ es, as Governor E@@ mili@@ o G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ ez said, when asked if there would be distribution of con@@ dom@@ s during his administration.
"@@ And it@@ 's not about sexu@@ ality, but it is best to provide con@@ dom@@ s to those already practi@@ sing sexual activ@@ it@@ y" he sa@@ id.
J@@ ali@@ sc@@ o key points
There are 1@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 35 cumulative cases (@@ 1@@ 2,@@ 15@@ 8 AIDS and 1,@@ 3@@ 17 HIV@@ ).
The state is 4@@ th in the nation in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13@@ th in HIV@@ .
9@@ 2% of new infec@@ tions are through sex@@ , 6% via the blood@@ stream and 2% per@@ in@@ at@@ al.
An estimated 50,000 people may be living with HIV@@ , as for each regi@@ stered case there are around 4-@@ 5 people who do not know they are posi@@ tive.
Rati@@ fied by a United States court of appe@@ al, a jud@@ gement which ignores the restructuring of the Vit@@ ro Gro@@ up@@ 's debt achieved via a bankruptcy in Mexico, the scenario is an omin@@ ous precedent for any national company with offic@@ es in the neigh@@ bo@@ uring country that has solvency problems.
It seems, then, that the proceed@@ ings in support of survival of firms permit Mexican law are not vali@@ d in the land of stars and stri@@ p@@ es, contrary to international conven@@ tions.
In practical terms, the endor@@ s@@ ement of the jud@@ gement delivered on 15 June by Jud@@ ge Har@@ lin H@@ ale of the Bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy Court of the Northern Di@@ strict of Tex@@ as, leaves Mexican firms def@@ enc@@ eless against possible sei@@ z@@ ure of their property outside of Mexico@@ .
However, the decision op@@ ens the door for the leading gl@@ ass manufactur@@ er in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming three in@@ consist@@ en@@ cies.
From the start, while the trial judge no@@ tes that creditors should be governed by the United States Bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy Co@@ de, the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al for the Fif@@ th C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it, based in New Orle@@ ans, states that the main action is the in@@ solvency action handled in Mexico@@ .
The first point would involve ignoring international procedu@@ ral cooperation in cases of in@@ solvency of companies with transnational prof@@ il@@ es.
Indeed, the UN Mo@@ del Law for International Trade Law Uni@@ form@@ ity was created for this purpo@@ se, with the American Law Institute posi@@ tioned as arbit@@ rat@@ or.
Sec@@ ond@@ ly, the jud@@ gement establish@@ es that without the inter@@ company vote, with the debts the Vit@@ ro subsidi@@ aries had with their par@@ ent company reco@@ g@@ nis@@ ed in the critical mass of the in@@ solven@@ cy, the majority needed to approve the restructuring might not be achieved.
However, Mexican law reco@@ g@@ nis@@ es the possi@@ bility.
In fact, the Vit@@ ro case was not the first one in which the scheme was accep@@ ted.
There are half a dozen exam@@ pl@@ es, including Agre@@ me@@ x and Com@@ mer@@ cial Mex@@ ic@@ ana, whose inter@@ company debts were endorsed by the Federal Bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy Institu@@ te.
What is also certain is that, not including the votes of subsidi@@ aries, the Vit@@ ro creditors who fought against it in the US cour@@ ts, namely "@@ vul@@ ture@@ " funds such as Au@@ reli@@ os Capit@@ al, Au@@ reli@@ os Con@@ vergen@@ ce, E@@ lli@@ ot International and Li@@ ver@@ pool Lim@@ it@@ ed, did not achieve a majority.
The vote was apparently 45 perc@@ ent versus 3@@ 7.
This data is om@@ it@@ ted by the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al.
From another perspective, the latter blam@@ es Vit@@ ro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008, while trying to avoid the severe economic crisis faced by the United States, turning its back on the country.
For now, the G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ ez S@@ ada family firm has lo@@ d@@ ged a motion for re@@ consideration before the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al for the vote to reach the pl@@ en@@ ary of the cour@@ t, that is, the five jud@@ ges, given that only three voted pre@@ vi@@ ously.
Should this fail, an appeal for review by a higher cour@@ t, in this case the US Supreme Cour@@ t, will be fi@@ led.
The real problem is that the court b@@ yp@@ ass@@ ed a document sent by the Government of Mexico in the capacity of am@@ ic@@ us curi@@ a@@ e (@@ "@@ friend of the Cour@@ t@@ "@@ ), which details the proced@@ ure followed by Vit@@ ro under the framework of the Com@@ mer@@ cial Insolven@@ cy Law@@ , no@@ ting that the latter di@@ sch@@ arg@@ ed itself with adher@@ ence to the agreements signed by the two countries to link it with Ch@@ apter 15 of the Bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy Act of the United States.
Moreover, it should be noted that the country yiel@@ ded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Tra@@ de, that is the rules set for cross-border in@@ solvency cases, ensuring fairness for deb@@ tors and credi@@ tors.
D@@ ou@@ ble wh@@ am@@ my@@ : Vit@@ ro hit and country h@@ it.
Bal@@ ance S@@ he@@ et
With the complaints put on the table by the unions of Mex@@ ic@@ ana Air@@ lines against the former ow@@ ner of the company, Gast@@ ó@@ n A@@ z@@ c@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga An@@ dra@@ de, who is accused of mis@@ management, dor@@ man@@ t for several months, the Air@@ line P@@ ilo@@ ts Union Association already found the bott@@ len@@ eck@@ .
The proceed@@ ings headed by Car@@ los Di@@ a@@ z Cha@@ vez Mor@@ ine@@ au has just fil@@ ed a criminal compla@@ int against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruc@@ ting justice.
The claim is that the supervisory authority has consistently refused to provide reports to the At@@ tor@@ ney General@@ 's Office on a transaction carried out by the employ@@ er to remove 19@@ 8 million pes@@ os from trust F@@ /@@ 5@@ 8@@ 9 of B@@ anc@@ o I@@ X@@ E, on behalf of Mex@@ ic@@ ana de Avi@@ aci@@ ó@@ n.
The resources were apparently chann@@ elled towards the purchase of shares in the company Administ@@ ra@@ dor@@ a Prof@@ esi@@ on@@ al de Ho@@ tel@@ es.
As you know, A@@ z@@ car@@ ra@@ ga An@@ dra@@ de is the main sharehol@@ der of the Po@@ sa@@ das ho@@ tel chain@@ .
Op@@ posing Dra@@ g@@ on Mar@@ t
A group of local and foreign environment@@ alists, academ@@ ics, business@@ men and members of the public gathered at the week@@ end at a forum at the University of the Caribbe@@ an to approve the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dra@@ g@@ on Mar@@ t in Canc@@ un.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution cent@@ re in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbe@@ an, selling Chinese products, with a residential area at the bottom for employees of 150 companies.
Pre@@ viously, Can@@ ac@@ in@@ tra had managed to unite the govern@@ ors of the sou@@ theast of Mexico to oppose the monum@@ ental building that destroyed part of a protected area and represents the mother of all threats to industry.
The death of AC@@ T@@ A
The Government ignored an order of the Senate to explain under what terms and conditions the Mexican Am@@ b@@ ass@@ ador in Japan signed the Anti-@@ Co@@ unter@@ fei@@ ting Trade Agre@@ ement, known by its ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m AC@@ T@@ A, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Pro@@ per@@ ty, and the matter has already been arch@@ i@@ ved.
As you know, the action was taken even though the Senate had ruled out the possi@@ bility, deem@@ ing it an inf@@ rin@@ gement of freedom of expression on social network@@ s.
Hom@@ e@@ x long term
In effort to repay long-term debt without affecting short-term debt, the housing develop@@ er Hom@@ e@@ x is placing securities exchange cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates on the market for 500 million pes@@ os.
The issue is the first of four iden@@ tical issues which are offering to repay interest every 28 days.

A con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um under the name Com@@ pe@@ tiv@@ al has just been establish@@ ed, compri@@ sing the companies N@@ Y@@ CE@@ , e-@@ Qu@@ ality and Kern@@ et, leaders in information technology, the objective of which will be to market the services of software clu@@ sters in Central and South America.

H@@ ec@@ tor "@@ H@@ et@@ in@@ " Re@@ y@@ es: "@@ Bas@@ ket@@ ball has been my life@@ "
Bas@@ ket@@ ball glo@@ betro@@ t@@ ter H@@ ec@@ tor "@@ H@@ et@@ in@@ " Re@@ y@@ es was involved in the sport for over 60 years and, thanks to it, tra@@ v@@ elled the world.
Few people in Puerto R@@ ico have a mental rec@@ ol@@ lec@@ tion of local bas@@ ket@@ ball history as broad as that of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor "@@ H@@ et@@ in@@ " Re@@ y@@ es.
Re@@ y@@ es was immer@@ sed in the sport for over 60 years before being confined to a whe@@ el@@ ch@@ air in 2008 following a stro@@ ke@@ ; he was a minor le@@ ague play@@ er, National Sup@@ eri@@ or Bas@@ ket@@ ball play@@ er, BS@@ N representative and manager with the Bay@@ am@@ ó@@ n V@@ a@@ qu@@ er@@ os or President of the Bas@@ ket@@ ball Feder@@ ation.
"@@ I wor@@ e lo@@ ts of hat@@ s in bas@@ ket@@ ball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of the BS@@ N, general manager and feder@@ ative president of the National Team during the '@@ 90@@ s@@ ," rec@@ alled Re@@ y@@ es during Pri@@ mer@@ a Hor@@ a's visit to his home in Bay@@ am@@ ó@@ n, where he lives with Is@@ ab@@ el, his loyal wife for over 50 years.
"@@ Bas@@ ket@@ ball has been my life@@ ."
Re@@ y@@ es is not exagger@@ ating when he makes that stat@@ ement.
The walls of his house are almost totally dec@@ or@@ ated with pic@@ tures and memor@@ abili@@ a den@@ o@@ ting his long care@@ er, which goes to prove it.
Bay@@ am@@ ó@@ n at heart
Of them all, the ones he treas@@ ures with the most emo@@ tion are the ones that remind him of his time spent with the V@@ a@@ qu@@ ero@@ s, from the mid-@@ 50@@ s as a player until 198@@ 2, when he completed 15 years serving as co-@@ ag@@ ent or ag@@ ent of the fran@@ ch@@ is@@ e.
"@@ Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of the V@@ a@@ qu@@ ero@@ s' eight champi@@ on@@ ships, since 196@@ 7, either as ag@@ ent, co-@@ ag@@ ent or manag@@ er.
There were many good years, including the five con@@ secu@@ tive champi@@ on@@ ships from 197@@ 1 to 197@@ 5.
And then I said good@@ by@@ e with one in 198@@ 1, Jer@@ ome M@@ inc@@ y's de@@ but year in the BS@@ N@@ .
Then "@@ C@@ u@@ co@@ " Or@@ ti@@ z took over - he was a great manag@@ er@@ " said Re@@ y@@ es.
I remember that Gene Bar@@ to@@ w, who had directed here and was at the University of Al@@ ab@@ ama (@@ Bir@@ m@@ ing@@ ham@@ ), said to me '@@ I@@ '@@ ve got a very strong player for you@@ , 6@@ '@@ 7@@ " t@@ all.
Do you want him@@ ?@@ '
And that was the beginning of M@@ inc@@ y, one of the best players Puerto R@@ ico ever h@@ ad.
Bar@@ to@@ w then recommended the sharp@@ shoo@@ ter G@@ aus@@ se R@@ ay@@ mon@@ d, who established residen@@ cy here and was one of our best shoo@@ ters.
I remember him saying that if Min@@ cy had given Bay@@ am@@ on one champi@@ on@@ ship, G@@ aus@@ se would help get another.
The V@@ a@@ qu@@ ero@@ s' champi@@ on@@ ship with G@@ aus@@ se was enjo@@ y@@ ed, but from a dist@@ ance, because in 1988 he was already becoming a feder@@ ative big@@ sho@@ t.
For that time, he preferred to enjoy his own and M@@ inc@@ y's accomplish@@ ments in the national te@@ am.
I remember when we beat the United States for the first time during the 1989 Pre@@ -@@ Olymp@@ ics in Mexico@@ .
Then came the 1990 World C@@ up, where we came fourth and it should have been b@@ ron@@ ze, but for the Can@@ adian refer@@ ee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, said Re@@ y@@ es.
Is the 1990 World National Team the best you@@ '@@ ve ever se@@ en?
It@@ 's one of the best, as good as the one that beat the Dre@@ am Team in the 2004 Olymp@@ ics.
However, my fa@@ v@@ ou@@ ri@@ te was the one in the 1991 P@@ an American G@@ ames in Cub@@ a, when we won gold and gave the US team a be@@ ating, which was quite similar to the time we won b@@ ron@@ ze at the World C@@ up.
That team not only again included M@@ inc@@ y, G@@ aus@@ se, Ram@@ on Riv@@ as, F@@ ico L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z and '@@ P@@ icul@@ í@@ n@@ ' (@@ Or@@ tiz@@ ), but also the young (@@ Ja@@ vier@@ ) '@@ To@@ ñ@@ ito@@ ' Col@@ ó@@ n and James Car@@ ter, the Le@@ on bro@@ thers (@@ Francis@@ co and Ed@@ gar@@ ) and Mario '@@ Qu@@ i@@ jo@@ te@@ ' Moral@@ es, who was kept out of the 90 team by a k@@ ne@@ e inj@@ ur@@ y.
A team that maybe was not the best in terms of members, but which gave us a gold med@@ al and was a great jo@@ y to work with@@ , was the 1995 Pre@@ -@@ Olympic team in Neu@@ qu@@ en, Argentin@@ a.
With role players such as '@@ Can@@ ito@@ ' Ni@@ ev@@ es, P@@ ab@@ lo A@@ lic@@ e@@ a and the young Rol@@ and@@ o H@@ our@@ ru@@ it@@ in@@ er replacing the players suspended after the sham@@ bles of the M@@ ar del Plat@@ a P@@ an-@@ American Gam@@ es, we won gold against all the od@@ ds.
Who was the best Puerto Ri@@ can play@@ er@@ ?
Without any doubt, P@@ icul@@ í@@ n Or@@ tiz@@ .
His numbers at international to@@ ur@@ nam@@ ent level are a@@ wes@@ om@@ e.
No@@ body in Puerto R@@ ico has dominated at that level like P@@ icul@@ í@@ n did.
Not to mention his career in the various le@@ agu@@ es he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Ri@@ can manag@@ er@@ ?
That@@ 's a difficult one.
We had a very good te@@ am, including Juli@@ o Tor@@ o, Fl@@ or Mel@@ en@@ de@@ z, Car@@ los Moral@@ es, R@@ ay@@ mon@@ d Dal@@ mau@@ , Ar@@ man@@ di@@ to Tor@@ res.
Of the young@@ ster@@ s, I really like the work of Le@@ o Ari@@ ll@@ .
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the feder@@ ation?
Having been part of the National Te@@ am@@ 's most gl@@ ori@@ ous era between 1988 and 1995 and in the early 90@@ s the BS@@ N had up to 17 teams in a seas@@ on.
What was there left for you to do@@ ?
There were things I@@ '@@ d have lik@@ ed to imp@@ le@@ ment, such as region@@ alis@@ ing the minor le@@ agu@@ es.
For example, the boys of P@@ once only play in their area and only get to face teams from other parts of the island in the national play@@ off@@ s.
Right now the ki@@ ds are riding and playing too much, un@@ necess@@ ar@@ ily.
At least I see the fru@@ it of compul@@ sor@@ y cer@@ ti@@ fications and a course for leaders, table officials and refer@@ e@@ es.
That pleas@@ es me.
What are you doing now@@ ?
The most I do is listen to musi@@ c, watch musi@@ c vide@@ os from my era on You@@ Tu@@ be, enjoy my grand@@ children and occasionally go to bas@@ ket@@ ball gam@@ es.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wi@@ fe, Eli@@ z@@ abe@@ th, who has always been with me.
Ac@@ tor Larry H@@ ag@@ man dies
Larry H@@ ag@@ man, born on 21 September 193@@ 1 in For@@ t Wor@@ th (@@ Tex@@ as@@ ), became world famous for his role as John Ro@@ ss E@@ w@@ ing, better known as "@@ J@@ R@@ ," in the television series "@@ D@@ all@@ as@@ ," in which he played a ruth@@ less, mali@@ cious and manipul@@ ative business@@ man.
Larry H@@ ag@@ man, whose role as oil ty@@ co@@ on pre@@ dat@@ or J@@ R E@@ wing in the television series "@@ D@@ all@@ as@@ " became a symbol of gre@@ ed in the 1980s, has di@@ ed.
He was 8@@ 1.
H@@ ag@@ man, who returned this year as J@@ R in a new seas@@ on of "@@ D@@ all@@ as@@ ," died on Fri@@ day after@@ no@@ on of cancer complic@@ ations, according to a family statement provided to the Associ@@ ated Pres@@ s by the War@@ ner Bro@@ s@@ ., produc@@ er of "@@ D@@ all@@ as@@ ."
"@@ Larry was back in his bel@@ o@@ ved hom@@ et@@ own of D@@ all@@ as, once again representing the i@@ con@@ ic role he most lik@@ ed@@ " the family sa@@ id.
Lar@@ r@@ y's family and closest friends were with him in D@@ all@@ as for the Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving Day holi@@ day.
Lin@@ da Gra@@ y, who played his wife in the original series and the sequ@@ el, was with H@@ ag@@ man when he died in a hospital in D@@ all@@ as, said her publi@@ ci@@ st, Jeff@@ rey L@@ an@@ e.
He brought jo@@ y to all who knew him.
He was cre@@ ative, gener@@ ous, fun@@ n@@ y, lo@@ ving and tal@@ ent@@ ed, and I will miss him de@@ ar@@ ly.
"@@ He was an original gu@@ y and lived life to the ful@@ l@@ " said Gra@@ y in a stat@@ ement.
H@@ ag@@ man was diagno@@ sed with cir@@ r@@ ho@@ sis of the li@@ ver in 1992 and admitted that he had dr@@ unk a lot over the years.
In 1995 a ma@@ lig@@ n@@ ant tum@@ our as found in his li@@ ver and he under@@ went a tran@@ sp@@ lan@@ t.
Year@@ s before "@@ D@@ all@@ as@@ ," H@@ ag@@ man became famous on television as a decent gu@@ y in the light com@@ ed@@ y "@@ I Dre@@ am of Je@@ anni@@ e@@ ," ai@@ red on N@@ B@@ C from 196@@ 5 to 1970@@ .
He played Cap@@ tain Tony N@@ el@@ son, an ast@@ ron@@ aut whose life is changed when he me@@ ets an attractive gen@@ ie, played by Bar@@ bar@@ a E@@ den, and takes her home to live with him.
He also star@@ red in two si@@ t@@ com@@ s that were not ai@@ red for long, "@@ The Good Li@@ fe@@ " (N@@ B@@ C, 197@@ 1-@@ 7@@ 2) and "@@ Here We G@@ o Again@@ " (@@ AB@@ C, 197@@ 3@@ ).
His film work included roles well received by critics in "@@ The Gro@@ up@@ ," "@@ Har@@ ry and Ton@@ to@@ " and "@@ Prim@@ ary Col@@ or@@ s@@ ."
But it was his master@@ ful interpretation of de@@ ligh@@ t@@ fully de@@ test@@ able J@@ R that led to H@@ ag@@ man reaching his peak of star@@ dom@@ .
The dra@@ ma series on CB@@ S about the E@@ wing cl@@ an and other charac@@ ters in their or@@ bit ai@@ red from April 1978 to May 199@@ 1.
The tag@@ line "@@ Who shot J@@ R@@ ?@@ ," designed to generate h@@ yp@@ e around an episode full of emo@@ tions in which H@@ ag@@ man@@ 's character is nearly kil@@ led, generated international speculation and millions of risky dollars wag@@ ered in gam@@ ing establish@@ ments.
It also helped give the series a record audience at the time.
When the answer was revealed in an episode in November 1980, an average of 4@@ 1 million vi@@ e@@ wers tun@@ ed in and made "@@ D@@ all@@ as@@ " the second most watched entertain@@ ment programme in history, after the final episode of "@@ MAS@@ H@@ " in 198@@ 3, which had 50 million vi@@ e@@ wer@@ s.
It was J@@ R@@ 's si@@ ster@@ -@@ in-@@ law Kri@@ sti@@ n (@@ played by M@@ ary Cro@@ s@@ by@@ ) who shot him.
J@@ R got her pregn@@ ant then threatened to say she was a pro@@ stitu@@ te unless she left tow@@ n, but there were others who also had reasons to attack him.
H@@ ag@@ man portra@@ yed E@@ wing as a corrupt ins@@ ati@@ able man with a charism@@ atic sm@@ i@@ le: a dish@@ on@@ est entrepreneu@@ r and che@@ ating hus@@ band who tried to have his alco@@ ho@@ lic wi@@ fe, S@@ ue E@@ llen (@@ Lin@@ da Gra@@ y), sec@@ tion@@ ed.
"@@ I know what I want on J@@ R@@ 's tom@@ b@@ st@@ one@@ " H@@ ag@@ man said in 198@@ 8.
It should read@@ : "@@ Here lies the honest citizen J@@ R E@@ w@@ ing@@ ."
This is the only deal he lost.
Vic@@ tori@@ a Prin@@ cip@@ al, co-@@ star of the original seri@@ es, rec@@ alled H@@ ag@@ man on Fri@@ day as someone "@@ hu@@ ge, on and off scre@@ en@@ ."
He is un@@ for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able and irre@@ plac@@ e@@ able, for millions of f@@ ans around the world, and in the hearts of each one of us who was fortun@@ ate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edi@@ tion of "@@ D@@ all@@ as@@ " were broad@@ cast a few months ago with great success for T@@ NT@@ .
He had already finished rec@@ ording five episodes for the second series and a six@@ th was in process, the chain repor@@ ted.
Im@@ medi@@ ately af@@ ter, there was no statement from War@@ ner or T@@ N@@ T about how the series would handle the loss of H@@ ag@@ man.
H@@ ag@@ man, born in For@@ t Wor@@ th, Tex@@ as, was the son of ac@@ t@@ ress and sing@@ er M@@ ary Mar@@ tin@@ , who star@@ red in classi@@ cs such as "@@ South Pacific@@ " and "@@ Peter Pan@@ ."
Martin was still a te@@ en@@ ager when she had him in 193@@ 1 during her marriage to lawy@@ er Ben H@@ ag@@ man.
He tried his luck in the New York the@@ at@@ re scene in the early '@@ 50@@ s, and later served in the Air Force from 195@@ 2 to 195@@ 6, in Eng@@ land.
While there, he met the young Swedish desig@@ ner Ma@@ j A@@ x@@ el@@ ss@@ on and married her.
The couple had two son@@ s, Pres@@ ton and Hei@@ di, and lived for a long time in the Californi@@ an city Mali@@ bu@@ , home to many celeb@@ ri@@ ties.
In 2001, he called his mem@@ o@@ irs "@@ H@@ ell@@ o Dar@@ lin@@ '@@ : T@@ all (and Ab@@ sol@@ utely Tru@@ e) T@@ ales Ab@@ out My Li@@ fe@@ ."
"@@ I did@@ n't put anything in it that I believed would hurt anyone or affect them in any way@@ " he told Associ@@ ated Pres@@ s at the time.
After his li@@ ver tran@@ sp@@ lan@@ t, he became an or@@ gan don@@ ation promo@@ ter and worked as a volun@@ te@@ er at a hospit@@ al, helping fear@@ ful pati@@ ents.
"@@ I adv@@ ise them, encourage them, meet with them when they come for their surger@@ y, and after@@ ward@@ s" he said in 199@@ 6.
I try to offer some comfor@@ t, such as "@@ Don@@ 't be afra@@ id, it will be a little un@@ comfortable for a short time, but then you@@ '@@ ll be fin@@ e@@ ."
He was also an anti-@@ smo@@ king activist and took part in several campaig@@ ns.
Start of a course that explor@@ es the "@@ End of the Worl@@ d@@ "
Each week, students expl@@ ore apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic them@@ es such as nuclear war, z@@ ombi@@ es, virus@@ es and ger@@ ms, and global warming.
This term, when Professor of religion, Stu@@ art Ch@@ arm@@ é@@ , decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew he had a compelling ho@@ ok@@ : The end of the "@@ long coun@@ t@@ down@@ " of the May@@ an cal@@ en@@ dar, 21 December, which had convinced many people that the end of the world was com@@ ing.
But Ch@@ arm@@ é had no idea what awa@@ ited him over the next couple of month@@ s: The cat@@ ac@@ ly@@ sm@@ ic hurrican@@ e Sand@@ y, a fiscal preci@@ pi@@ ce some called "@@ debt Ar@@ ma@@ ged@@ don@@ " and a growing conflict involving Israel, where end@@ -@@ of-@@ the-@@ world Christians theor@@ ists think the A@@ po@@ cal@@ yp@@ se will beg@@ in.
"@@ I did@@ n't reali@@ se this was going to be the most apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic term ever@@ " said Ch@@ arm@@ é this week to students at R@@ ut@@ ger@@ s-@@ Cam@@ den University (@@ New Jer@@ se@@ y).
If you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and coun@@ ting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those with an apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic ment@@ ality.
And he is not the only professor who offers cour@@ ses on the "@@ end of the world@@ " this term, theore@@ tically the last in history.
At T@@ emp@@ le, Associ@@ ate Professor Bar@@ ry V@@ ack@@ er is giving the course "@@ Medi@@ a, Cul@@ ture and the end of the world@@ ."
Each week, students expl@@ ore apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic them@@ es such as nuclear war, z@@ ombi@@ es, virus@@ es and ger@@ ms, and global warming.
"@@ We looked at why these ideas prolifer@@ ate over time@@ " he said, and how they offer hypo@@ the@@ tical scenarios that guide human behavi@@ our@@ .
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terror@@ ists, for example, a war could break out.
This month students analy@@ sed movi@@ es with an apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic them@@ e and expl@@ ored how they compare with real-@@ life exam@@ pl@@ es.
"@@ I@@ '@@ ve tried to in@@ form students about what is possible, prob@@ able, credible and im@@ possi@@ ble@@ " said V@@ ack@@ er.
At the main P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania State University camp@@ us, Latin American History Professor Mat@@ th@@ ew Rest@@ all, and his colle@@ ague Am@@ ara Sol@@ ari@@ , an Associ@@ ate Art History and An@@ th@@ rop@@ ology Profess@@ or, have team@@ ed up to give a course, called simply "@@ The end of the world@@ ."
"@@ We don't add '@@ 201@@ 2@@ ' so we always have the option of running the course again, if the world does@@ n't come to an end@@ " said Rest@@ all.
Despite the "@@ im@@ pending doom@@ ," students have to stud@@ y, undertake projects and take final exam@@ s.
At Pen@@ n State, the final ex@@ am will be taken on the eve of the A@@ po@@ cal@@ yp@@ se, which leaves students no choice but to work "@@ until the very night the world is supposed to end@@ " said Rest@@ all.
The cour@@ ses proved quite popul@@ ar.
"@@ It was fully book@@ ed within two hour@@ s" said Rest@@ all, on his course for students with high aver@@ ages, which was filled with 35 stud@@ ents.
We received em@@ ails for weeks and weeks before the start of the term, from people asking if there were any plac@@ es.
Stud@@ ents, meanwhile, say the course is one of the most interesting around.
"@@ I find it fasc@@ in@@ ating to see what people do to con@@ sole themsel@@ ves@@ " said Bri@@ d@@ gi@@ d Rob@@ in@@ son, a 2@@ 3-@@ year-old post-@@ graduate Religion and Soci@@ ology student from H@@ ad@@ don@@ fiel@@ d, New Jer@@ se@@ y, at R@@ ut@@ ger@@ s-@@ Cam@@ den.
And the apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic, secular or religious ment@@ ality is just a matter con@@ sol@@ ation or a lack of it.
Will W@@ ek@@ es@@ a, a 25-@@ year-old post-@@ graduate Psych@@ ology and N@@ ur@@ sing stud@@ ent, said he had seen all the apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic movi@@ es.
"@@ I@@ '@@ d never heard of a class that could teach it@@ " he sa@@ id.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students inter@@ viewed - much less any professor - said they believed in the end date of December 2@@ 1@@ st.
"@@ Our first project was about the May@@ an proph@@ ec@@ y and to a certain extent we discredited it@@ " said Juli@@ e Z@@ eg@@ l@@ en, a 2@@ 1-@@ year-old final year student at T@@ emp@@ le, from West Ch@@ es@@ ter.
The May@@ ans never predicted the end of the world@@ : it is just a key point in the cal@@ en@@ dar, said Rest@@ all.
But he said that Western culture suffers from apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic anxi@@ et@@ y, which goes back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them by predic@@ ting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in these specul@@ ations.
"@@ In other places, people don't think about it@@ " he sa@@ id.
It@@ 's mostly in the Engli@@ sh@@ -@@ speaking world.
Joseph D@@ ough@@ er@@ ty, a Professor of religion at L@@ a S@@ alle University, who is giving cour@@ ses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about any cour@@ ses on the "@@ end of the world@@ " there.
"@@ The Philippines are not taking part in the end of the world@@ " he wro@@ te, suggesting an exception of a higher authority.
We have an in@@ dul@@ gence from the Pop@@ e.
Rest@@ all noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the last jud@@ gement, and said that if nothing happens on December 2@@ 1@@ st, "@@ people will immediately start thinking of the next dat@@ e" or philosoph@@ is@@ ing that December 2@@ 1@@ st is the beginning of a se@@ ven@@ -year period after which the world will end.
Stud@@ ents and teachers are taking the date ligh@@ tly.
Some said they plan to go to "@@ end of the world@@ " parties.
"@@ May@@ be I@@ '@@ ll call some friends so we can have a lau@@ gh toge@@ ther@@ " said Sam@@ ir@@ a For@@ d, 20-@@ year-old communications stud@@ ent.
